<main><h2>Semantic and Style Elements</h2>
    <section><h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
        <p>Elements in the DOM represent things, they have intrinsic meaning, also known as <em>semantics</em>.
            <i>Elements, attributes and attribute values</i> in HTML are defined to have certain
            semantics or meanings.
            In HTML there are semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web
            page.
            These definitions allow HTML processors, such as <i>web browsers or search engines</i>,
            to present and use documents and applications in a wide variety of contexts.
        <ul>
            <li><em>Semantic Elements</em> - A semantic element clearly describes its
                meaning/content to both the browser and the developer;
                some semantic elements include: <em>&lt;main>, &lt;summary> and &lt;article></em>
            </li>
            <li><em>Non-Semantic Elements</em> - Non-semantic elements, tell/represent nothing about
                its content, some examples of non-semantic elements are:
                &lt;div> and &lt;span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Authors must not use <i>elements, attributes or attribute values</i> for purposes other than
        their appropriate intended semantic purpose, as doing so prevents software from correctly
        processing the page.
        According to the W3C: <cite>"A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across
            applications, enterprises, and communities."</cite>
        </p>
        <aside><h4>Block and Inline Elements</h4>
            <p>Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it
                is; there are two display values, <em><b>block</b> and <b>inline</b></em>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Block-level Elements</strong> - A block-level element always starts on a
                    new line, and browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after
                    the element.
                    A block-level element always takes up the full width available, as it stretches
                    out to the left and right as far as it can.
                    The block-level elements in HTML are the following: <em><b>&lt;address> &lt;article>
                        &lt;aside> &lt;blockquote> &lt;canvas> &lt;dd> &lt;div>
                        &lt;dl> &lt;dt> &lt;fieldset> &lt;figcaption> &lt;figure> &lt;footer> &lt;form>
                        &lt;h1>-&lt;h6> &lt;header> &lt;hr> &lt;li> &lt;main>
                        &lt;nav> &lt;noscript> &lt;ol> &lt;p> &lt;pre> &lt;section> &lt;table> &lt;tfoot>
                        &lt;ul> &lt;video></b></em>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Inline Elements</strong> - An inline element does not start on a new
                    line, and will only take up as much width as necessary; it cannot contain a
                    block-level element.
                    The inline elements in HTML are the following: <em><b>&lt;a> &lt;abbr> &lt;acronym>
                        &lt;b> &lt;bdo> &lt;big> &lt;br> &lt;button> &lt;cite>
                        &lt;code> &lt;dfn> &lt;em> &lt;i> &lt;img> &lt;input> &lt;kbd> &lt;label>
                        &lt;map> &lt;object> &lt;output> &lt;q> &lt;samp> &lt;script>
                        &lt;select> &lt;small> &lt;span> &lt;strong> &lt;sub> &lt;sup> &lt;textarea>
                        &lt;time> &lt;tt> &lt;var></b></em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        </aside>

        <h4>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 Elements - &lt;h1> &lt;h2> &lt;h3> &lt;h4> &lt;h5>
            &lt;h6></h4>
        <p>These elements represent <i>headings</i> for their sections, and have a rank (heading
            level) given by the number in their name;
            the level corresponds to levels of nested sections.
            The <em>&lt;h1></em> element defines the most important heading, and <em>&lt;h6></em>
            the least; browsers automatically add whitespace (margin) before and after a heading.
            <br/> <b><em>Headings Are Important</em></b> - Users often skim a page by its headings,
            and search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of web pages;
            is important to use headings to show the document structure.
            User agents are encouraged to expose page outlines to users to aid in navigation, this
            is especially true for non-visual media, e.g. screen readers.
            Use HTML headings for headings only, don't use them to make text big or bold.
        </p>

        <h4>hgroup Element - &lt;hgroup></h4>
        <p>Element is used to group a set of <em>&lt;h1>–&lt;h6></em> elements when the heading has
            multiple levels, such as <i>subheadings, alternative titles or taglines</i>.
            The element may be used to group an &lt;h1>–&lt;h6> element with one or more
            <em>&lt;p></em> elements containing content representing a <i>subheading, alternative
                title or tagline</i>.
            Other &lt;h1>–&lt;h6> elements of heading content in the &lt;hgroup> element indicate
            <i>subheadings, subtitles or alternative titles</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>p Element - &lt;p></h4>
        <p>Element represents a paragraph, a paragraph always starts on a new line and usually is a
            block of text;
            browsers add some whitespace (margin) before and after a paragraph.
        </p>

        <h4>hr Element - &lt;hr></h4>
        <p>Element defines a thematic break in an HTML page, is used to separate content or define a
            change in an HTML page - the HTML <em><b>Horizontal Rule</b></em>.
        </p>

        <h4>main Element - &lt;main></h4>
        <p>Element specifies the main content of a document, each &lt;main> element must be a <em>hierarchically
            correct</em> main element.
            A <strong>hierarchically correct</strong> main element is one whose <em>ancestor
                elements</em> are limited to <i>html, body, div, form (without an accessible name)
                and autonomous custom elements</i>.
            The element should not be a descendant of: <em>&lt;article>, &lt;aside>, &lt;footer>,
                &lt;header> or &lt;nav></em>.
            A document must not have more than one &lt;main> element that does not have the <em>hidden</em>
            attribute specified.
            The content inside the &lt;main> element should be unique to the document, and should
            not contain any content repeated across documents such as <i>sidebars, navigation links,
                copyright information, site logos and search forms</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>header Element - &lt;header></h4>
        <p>Element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids, and is intended to
            usually contain the section's heading, but is not required.
            The &lt;header> element can also be used to <i>wrap a section's table of contents,
                authorship information, a search form or any relevant logos</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>footer Element - &lt;footer></h4>
        <p>Element represents a footer for its nearest <em>ancestor sectioning content or sectioning
            root element</em>.
            A footer typically contains information about its section such as <i>who wrote it, links
                to related documents, copyright data and the like</i>.
            When the &lt;footer> element contains entire sections, they represent <i>appendices,
                indexes, long colophons, verbose license agreements and other such content</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>section Element - &lt;section></h4>
        <p>Element represents a section in a document, a thematic grouping of content; typically
            with a heading.
            A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents
            would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.
            Examples of sections would be <i>chapters, various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box
                or the numbered sections of a thesis</i>.
            A web site's home page could be split into sections for an <i>introduction, news items
                and contact information</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>article Element - &lt;article></h4>
        <p>Element defines an article or self-contained independent item of content.
            When article elements are nested, the <em>inner article</em> elements represent articles
            that are in principle related to contents of the <em>outer article</em>.
        </p>

        <h4>aside Element - &lt;aside> </h4>
        <p>Element defines content that consists of content tangentially related to the content
            around the element's content, and which could be considered separate from that content.
            Can be used for typographical effects like <i>pull quotes or sidebars for advertising,
                groups of nav elements and other content considered separate from the main
                content</i>.
        </p>

        <section><h4><big><em>Interactive Elements</em></big></h4>
            <h4>details Element - &lt;details></h4>
            <p>Element represents a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional
                information or controls, that the user can view or hide;
                by default the widget is closed.
                When open it expands and displays the content within, any sort of content can be put
                inside.
                The &lt;summary> element child of the element, if any, represents the <i>summary or
                    legend</i> of the details;
                the rest of element's contents represents the <i>additional information or
                    controls</i>.
            <details>
                <summary><b><em>details Attributes</em></b></summary>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>open</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The open content attribute is a <em>boolean attribute</em>, if present,
                        indicates that both the summary and additional information is to be shown to
                        the user:
                        <code>&lt;details <em>open</em>></code>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </details>
            </p>
            <h4>summary Element - &lt;summary></h4>
            <p>Element represents a <i>summary caption or legend</i> for the rest of the contents of
                the summary element's parent details element.
                The tag defines a visible heading for the details element, the heading can be
                clicked to view/hide details;
                it should be the first child element of the details element.
            </p>

            <h4>dialog Element - &lt;dialog></h4>
            <p>Element represents a transitory part of an application, in the form of a small window
                (dialog box), which the user interacts with to perform a task or gather information.
                Once the user is done, the dialog can be automatically closed by the application, or
                manually closed by the user.
                Especially for modal dialogs (a familiar pattern across applications), authors
                should ensure dialogs behave familiar to users of <i>non-web applications</i>.
                Authors should use the <em>autofocus</em> attribute on the descendant element of the
                dialog that the user is expected to immediately interact with after the dialog
                opens.
                Another important aspect of user behavior is whether dialogs are scrollable or not,
                in some cases, overflow
                (thus scroll-ability) cannot be avoided, e.g., when caused by user's high text zoom
                settings.
                Adding large text nodes directly to dialog elements is particularly bad, as it is
                likely to cause the dialog element to overflow - are best off avoiding them.
            <details>
                <summary><b><em>dialog Attributes</em></b></summary>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>open</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The open attribute is a <em>boolean attribute</em>, when specified indicates
                        the dialog element is active and that the user can interact with it:
                        <code>&lt;dialog <em>open</em>></code>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </details>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section><h3>Non-Semantic Elements</h3>
            <h4>div Element - &lt;div></h4>
            <p>Element defines a section in a document, it has no special meaning, but represents
                its children;
                it is used as a container for HTML elements.
                By default, browsers place a line break before and after the element;
                are strongly encouraged to view as an element of last resort, when no other element
                is suitable.
                Use of more appropriate elements instead of the &lt;div> element leads to better
                accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.
                On the other hand, &lt;div> elements can be useful for stylistic purposes or to wrap
                paragraphs within a section that are annotated a similar way.
                Is then styled with <em>CSS</em> or manipulated with <em>JavaScript</em>, it is
                easily styled by using the <em>class or id</em> attributes.
            </p>

            <h4>span Element - &lt;span></h4>
            <p>Element defines a section in a document, and it doesn't mean anything on its own, but
                represents its children.
                Can be useful when used together with the <em>global attributes</em>, and the &lt;span>
                tag is also easily styled by <em>CSS</em> or manipulated with <em>JavaScript</em>
                using <em>class or id</em> attributes.
                Is much like the <em>&lt;div></em> element, but &lt;div> is a <em><b>block-level</b></em>
                element, and &lt;span> an <em><b>inline element</b></em>;
                it is an inline container used to mark up part of a text or document.
            </p>
        </section>

    </section>

    <section><h2>Text Formatting and Semantics</h2>
        <p>HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
            <em><b>Phrasing content</b></em> is the text of the document, as well as elements that
            mark up that text at the <em>intra-paragraph</em> level.
            Most elements categorized as <em>phrasing content</em>, can only contain elements that
            are themselves categorized phrasing content.
        </p>

        <h4>b Element - &lt;b></h4>
        <p>Element specifies bold text, and is a text to which attention is being drawn; such as <i>key
            words, product names, article lede or actionable words in text-driven software</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>bdi Element - &lt;bdi></h4>
        <p>Element isolates a part of text that might be formatted in a different direction from
            other text outside it, <em>BDI</em> stands for "<strong><em>Bi-Directional
                Isolation</em></strong>".
            This element is especially useful when embedding user-generated content, with an unknown
            directionality.
            The global <em>dir</em> attribute, defaults to auto on this element, and never inherits
            from the parent element like with other elements.
        </p>
        <h4>bdo Element - &lt;bdo></h4>
        <p>Element represents explicit text directionality formatting control for its children, <em>BDO</em>
            stands for "<em><b>Bi-Directional Override</b></em>".
            It allows authors to override the <em>Unicode bidirectional algorithm</em>, by
            explicitly specifying a direction override.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>bdo Attributes</em></b> - Authors must specify the global <em>dir</em>
                attribute, with the value ltr to specify left-to-right override, and rtl to specify
                right-to-left override;
                the auto value must not be specified.
            </summary>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>dir</strong> - (Required)</dt>
                <dd>Specifies the direction of text inside the &lt;bdo> element: <code>&lt;bdo
                    dir=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </details>
        </p>

        <h4>em Element - &lt;em></h4>
        <p>Element defines emphasized text, typically displayed in italic; placement of stress
            emphasis changes meaning of the sentence, thus it forms an integral part of the content.
            The level of stress a piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor &lt;em>
            elements;
            way in which stress is used in this way depends on the language.
            A <i>screen reader</i> will pronounce the words in emphasis, using verbal stress.
        </p>

        <h4>i Element - &lt;i></h4>
        <p>Element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood, the content inside is
            typically displayed in italic.
            The tag is often used to indicate a <i>technical term, phrase from another language,
                thought, name, etc</i>.
            Terms in languages different from the main text, should be annotated with the global
            <em>lang</em> attribute.
        </p>

        <h4>strong Element - &lt;strong></h4>
        <p>Element represents <i>strong importance, seriousness or urgency</i> for its contents;
            content inside is typically displayed in bold.
            The relative level of importance of content is given by its number of ancestor &lt;strong>
            elements;
            each &lt;strong> element increases importance of its contents.
        </p>

        <h4>u Element - &lt;u></h4>
        <p>Element defines span of text articulated and styled differently from normal text, such
            as <i>misspelled words or proper names</i>;
            content inside is typically displayed with an underline.
            The default rendering in visual presentations clashes with conventional rendering of <i>hyperlinks</i>,
            as both have underlining.
            Authors are encouraged to avoid using the &lt;u> element, where it could be confused for
            a hyperlink.
        </p>
        <aside><h3>Line Breaking & Whitespace Elements</h3>
            <h4>br Element - &lt;br></h4>
            <p>Element defines a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph, it is an
                <em>empty element</em>, which means it has no end tag.
                The &lt;br> element is useful when writing <i>addresses or poems</i>.
            </p>

            <h4>pre element - &lt;pre> </h4>
            <p>Element represents a block of <i>preformatted text</i>, in which structure is
                represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements.
                The text is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and preserves both
                <i>spaces and line breaks</i>;
                it is displayed as written in the HTML source code.
                Authors are encouraged to consider how preformatted text will be experienced, as
                will be the case for users of <i>speech synthesizers, braille displays and the
                    like</i>.
            </p>

            <h4>wbr Element - &lt;wbr></h4>
            <p>Element defines a possible line-break, a '<em>Word Break Opportunity</em>', the tag
                specifies where in a text it would be ok to add a line-break.
                When a word is too long, the browser might break it at the wrong place; you can use
                the &lt;wbr> element to add word break opportunities.

                of the &lt;dfn> element, also contains the definition(s) for the term given by the
                element.
                If the <em>title</em> attribute is present, it must contain only the term being
                defined; the exact value of that attribute is the term being defined.
                The term inside the &lt;dfn> tag can be with an &lt;abbr> tag, or with the
                <em>id</em> attribute added.

                the &lt;figure> element's contents.
                When a figure is referred to from the main content by identifying it by its caption
                (e.g., figure number), it enables such content to be easily moved away from that
                primary content.
                The element can thus be used to annotate <i>illustrations, diagrams, photos, code
                    listings, etc</i>.

                Use ruby together with &lt;rt> and &lt;rp> elements, the ruby element consists of
                one or more characters that needs an explanation/pronunciation.
                An &lt;rt> element gives that information, and an optional &lt;rp> tag, defines what
                to show for browsers that do not support <em>ruby annotations</em>.
                The &lt;ruby> element represents the union of the segments of base text it contains,
                along with the mapping from those base text segments to annotation segments.

                element consists of one or more characters that needs an explanation/pronunciation.
                And an &lt;rt> element gives that information, an optional &lt;rp> element defines
                what to show for browsers that do not support ruby annotations.
            </p>
            <h4>rp Element - &lt;rp></h4>
            <p>Element can be used to provide parentheses or other content around a ruby text
                component of a <em>ruby annotation</em>, to be shown by user agents that don't
                support ruby annotations.
                Use the &lt;rp> tag together with &lt;ruby> and &lt;rt> elements, the &lt;ruby>
                element consists of one or more characters that needs an explanation/pronunciation.

            circles) by default;
            items are the &lt;li> element child nodes of the element.
        </p>

        <h4>menu Element - &lt;menu></h4>
        <p>Element is a semantic alternative to the &lt;ul> element, to express an unordered list of
            commands, as a "toolbar";
            list items will usually be displayed with bullet points.
            Each of which represents a command the user can perform or activate, it is used for <i>context
                menus, toolbars and listing form controls or commands</i>.

        <h3>HTML Description Lists</h3>
        <p>HTML also supports description lists, a description list is a list of terms, with a
            description of each term.
            The &lt;dl> tag defines the description list, the &lt;dt> tag defines the term (name)
            and the &lt;dd> tag describes each term.
        </p>
        <h4>dl Element - &lt;dl></h4>
        <p>Element defines a description/association list, a description list is a list of terms
            with a description (name-value) for each.
            A <em>name-value group</em> consists of one or more names (&lt;dt> elements), followed
            by one or more values (&lt;dd> elements).
            Within a single &lt;dl> element, there should not be more than one &lt;dt> element for
            each name.
            <em><b>Name-value groups</b></em> may be <i>terms and definitions, metadata topics and
                values, questions and answers, or any other groups of name-value data</i>.
        </p>
        <h4>dt Element - &lt;dt></h4>
        <p>Element defines the term or name of a description group in a description list (&lt;dl>
            element).
            The tag is used in conjunction with the &lt;dl> tag, witch defines a description list,
            and &lt;dd> witch describes each term/name.
        </p>
        <h4>dd Element - &lt;dd></h4>
        <p>Element represents the description, definition or value, part of a term-description or
            name group in a description list (&lt;dl> element).
            The tag is used in conjunction with &lt;dl>, witch defines a description list and &lt;dt>
            witch defines terms/names.
            Inside a &lt;dd> tag, you can put <i>paragraphs, line breaks, images, links, lists,
                etc</i>.
        </p>

    <section><h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for <em><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b></em>, it's the language used to style
            HTML and describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
            With CSS you can control <i>color, font, text size, spacing, elements position,
                background images or colors, and much more</i>.
            The word <em>cascading</em> means a style applied to a parent element, will also apply
            to all children elements within the parent.
            If color of the body text is set to "blue", all headings, paragraphs and other text
            elements within the body, will also get the same color (unless specify something else).
            CSS can save a lot of work, you can control the layout of multiple web pages at once,
            including the layout and variations for different devices and screen sizes.
            <br/> <strong>CSS is added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol class="css-types">
            <li> Inline - An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element,
                and uses the global <em>style</em> attribute on an HTML element:
                <code>&lt;p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.&lt;/p> </code>
                - <abbr style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</abbr> - The property is a CSS property,
                and the value is a CSS value.
            </li>
            <li>Internal - An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page, using
                the &lt;style> element, in the webpage's &lt;head> section:
                <code>&lt;style> .css-types {list-style-type:upper-roman;
                    background-color:lightblue} &lt;/style></code>
                - This internal style is what changes our list type (using the <em>class</em>
                attribute 'css-types') to ‘upper-roman’ characters, and gives it a ‘lightblue’
                background.
                <style>
                    .css-types { list-style-type: upper-roman; background-color: lightblue }
                </style>
            </li>
            <li>External - To use an external style sheet, add a &lt;link> Element in the &lt;head>
                section of each HTML page;
                to link to the external CSS file(s).
                The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files, the
                external style sheet can be written in any text editor.
                The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a
                <em><b>.css</b></em> extension: <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"
                    href="stylesheet.css"></code>
                - External style sheets can also be referenced with a full URL or with a path
                relative to the current web page.
                With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by
                changing one file.
            </li>
        </ol>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p><strong><em>The id and class Attributes</em></strong>
            - The global <em>id</em> attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration, and
            the global <em>class</em> attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style
            sheet.
        <ul>
            <li><em>Syntax for id</em>: Write a <em>hash character (<b>#</b>)</em>, followed by an
                <em>id name</em>;
                then define the CSS properties within <em>curly braces <b>{}</b></em>: <code>#ElementId
                    { <em>property1: value; property2: value;</em> }</code>
            </li>
            <li><em>Syntax for class</em>: Write a <em>period character (<b>.</b>)</em>, followed by
                a <em>class name</em>;
                then define the CSS properties within <em>curly braces <b>{}</b></em>: <code>.className
                    { <em>property1: value; property2: value;</em> }</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>style Element - &lt;style></h4>
        <p>Element is used to define style information (<em><b>CSS</b></em>) for a document, inside
            of the &lt;style> element you specify how HTML elements should render.
            It allows authors to embed CSS style sheets into their documents, the element does not
            represent any content for the user.
            When a browser reads a <em>style sheet</em>, it will format the HTML document according
            to the information in the style sheet;
            to link to an external style sheet, use the &lt;link> tag.
            If properties have been defined for the same 'selector' (element), in different style
            sheets; the value from the last read style sheet will be used.
        </p>
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>style Attributes</em></b> - The <em>title</em> attribute on style
                elements defines CSS style sheet sets.
                The <em>title</em> attribute on style elements, like &lt;link>, will differ from the
                <em>global title attribute</em>;
                in that a style block without a title, does not inherit the title of the parent
                element, it merely has no title.

                        <li><em>grid</em> - Specifies if the output device is grid or bitmap,
                            possible values are <em>"1"</em> for grid, and <em>"0"</em> otherwise:
                            <code>media=<em>"handheld and (grid:1)"</em></code></li>

        <p>Specifies a default <i>color, size and font</i> for all text in a document - Not
            supported in HTML5, use <em>CSS</em> instead.</p>
        <h5>&lt;big></h5>
        <p>Defines big text - Not supported in HTML5, use <em>CSS</em> instead.</p>
        <h5>&lt;font></h5>
        <p>Defines <i>font, color and size</i> for text - Not supported in HTML5, use <em>CSS</em>
            instead.</p>
        <h5>&lt;tt></h5>
        <p>Was used in HTML 4 to define teletype/monospace text - Not Supported in HTML5.
            Consider the <em>&lt;kbd></em> element for keyboard input, the <em>&lt;var></em> element
            for variables, the <em>&lt;code></em> element for computer code, and <em>&lt;samp></em>
            element for computer output.
            Or, you can use <em>CSS</em> instead.

        <h3>HTML Colors</h3>
        <p>HTML colors are specified with predefined <em>color names and HEX, RGB, RGBA, HSL or
            HSLA</em> values:
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>Color Names</i></b> - In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name,
                HTML supports 140 standard color names;
                all modern browsers support them - See the <a target="_blank"
                                                              href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">Complete
                    List</a>.
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Hexadecimal Color</i></b> - In HTML, a hexadecimal color is specified with:
                <em>#RRGGBB</em> - The hexadecimal integers, <em><b>RR</b> for red</em>,
                <em><b>GG</b> for green</em> and <em><b>BB</b> for blue</em> specify the components
                of the color.
                Where <em>RR, GG and BB</em> are hexadecimal values between <em>00 and ff</em> (same
                as decimal 0-255).
            </li>
            <li><b><i>RGB</i></b> - An RGB color value represents Red, Green, and Blue light
                sources: <em>rgb(red, green, blue)</em>
                - Each parameter for <em>red, green and blue</em>, defines the intensity of the
                color; with a value between <em>0 and 255</em>.
            </li>
            <li><b><i>RGBA</i></b> - RGBA color values are an extension of <em>RGB</em> color values
                with an <em>Alpha channel</em>, which specifies the opacity for a color:
                <em>rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)</em>
                - The alpha parameter is a number between <em>0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not
                    transparent at all)</em>.
            </li>
            <li><b><i>HSL</i></b> - HSL stands for <em>hue, saturation and lightness</em>, in HTML,
                a color can be specified in the form: <em>hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)</em>
                - Hue is a degree on the color wheel from <em>0 to 360</em>, 0 is red, 120 is green,
                and 240 is blue.
                Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full
                color;
                saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.
                Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black and 100% is white; the lightness
                of a color can be described as how much light to give the color.
            </li>
            <li><b><i>HSLA</i></b> - HSLA color values are an extension of <em>HSL</em> color
                values, with an <em>Alpha channel</em>, which specifies the opacity for a color:
                <em>hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)</em>
                - The alpha parameter is a number between <em>0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not
                    transparent at all)</em>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <aside><b><em>Note:</em></b> HTML was never intended to contain tags for formatting a web
            page, it was created to describe the content (using elements) of a web page.
            When <i>font and color</i> attributes were added to HTML 3.2, it started a nightmare for
            web developers;
            information was added to every page, a long and expensive process.
            To solve this, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS; CSS removed the style
            formatting from the HTML page.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a
        complete understanding of some of the more technical parts.
        An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS
        will also be helpful in places but is not essential.
