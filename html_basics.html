<main><h2>HTML Elements</h2>
    <p><strong>Element Tags</strong> are used to delimit the start and end of Elements in the
        markup:
        <code><b> &lt;Start-Tag> <em>Element's Content!</em> &lt;/End-Tag> </b></code>
        - Start and end tags, in certain cases, can be omitted and are implied by other tags.
        Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag;
        however, never rely on this, as unexpected results and errors may occur - Never skip the
        <em>End Tag</em>.
        Elements whose content model is nothing are also, for convenience <em><b>Void Elements</b>
            or <b>Empty Elements</b></em> and are Elements that have no <em>end tag</em>:
        <code><b> &lt;Empty Element> </b></code>. <br/>
        HTML tags are not <em>case sensitive</em>, the HTML standard does not require lowercase
        tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML
        - In stricter document types like <em><b>XHTML</b></em>, it demands lowercase.
    </p>
    <h3>Nested Elements</h3>
    <p>HTML elements can be 'nested' (contain other elements), all HTML Documents consist of <em>Nested
        HTML Elements</em>.
        Tags have to be nested, such that elements are all completely within each other, without
        overlapping
        (such as in the <a target="_blank" href="HTML.html#sample_html">Sample HTML</a> on the
        site's <em>Main page</em>):
        <code>&lt;head> &lt;title>Page Tile&lt;/title> &lt;/head></code>
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Element Attributes</h2>
    <p>All Elements can have <em><b>Attributes</b></em> which control how the elements work, they
        provide additional information about <em>elements</em>.
        Attributes are always specified in the <em>start tag</em> and usually come in <em>name value
            pairs</em>, separated by an "<strong>=</strong>" character:
        <code><b>name=<em>"value"</em></b></code> <br/>
        An <em>attribute value</em> is a text string, except where otherwise specified, the value
        can remain unquoted if it doesn't contain <em>whitespace</em>, or the following characters:
        <em>" ' ` = < ></em>.
        Otherwise, it has to be quoted using either <em>single or double quotes</em>; double quotes
        around attribute values are the most common, but single quotes can also be used.
        When the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single
        quotes, or vice versa.
        The HTML Standard also does not require lowercase attribute names, however, W3C recommends
        to always use lowercase attributes names and quotes with attribute values.

    <h4>HTML Global Attributes</h4>
    <details>
        <summary> Global attributes are attributes that can be used with all HTML elements - Click
            to see the HTML Global Attributes.
        </summary>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>accesskey</strong></dt>
            <dd>The accesskey attribute's value is used by the user agent as a guide for creating a
                keyboard shortcut that activates or focuses the element.
                Each element that can be activated or focused can be assigned a single key
                combination to activate it.
                The accesskey attribute value must be a single character letter or digit, none of
                which identical to another token:
                <code>accesskey=<em>"value"</em></code>
                <br/>Using accesskeys is difficult because they may conflict with other key
                standards in the browser, the way of accessing the shortcut key element is varying
                in different browsers.
                Most browsers will use accesskeys only if pressed together with the Alt key.
                Adapting accesskeys to all international languages are difficult, the accesskey
                value may not be present on all keyboards.
                Because of these concerns, it is advised not to use accesskeys.
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>autocapitalize</strong></dt>
            <dd>Some methods of entering text, for example on mobile virtual keyboards and voice
                input, often assist users by capitalizing the first letter of sentences.
                The autocapitalize attribute allows authors to control such behavior: <code>autocapitalize=<em>"value"</em></code>
                <br/>A virtual keyboard that implements autocapitalization might automatically
                switch to showing uppercase letters.
                Other types of input, for example voice input, may perform autocapitalization in a
                way that does not give users an option to intervene first.
                The autocapitalize attribute, as typically implemented, does not affect behavior
                when typing on a physical keyboard.
                For this reason, as well as the ability for users to override or edit the behavior
                in some cases, the attribute must not be relied on for any input validation.
                <br/>The autocapitalization processing model is based on selecting among five
                autocapitalization hints, defined as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>default</em> - The user agent and input method should make their own
                        determination of whether or not to enable autocapitalization.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>none</em> - No autocapitalization should be applied (all letters should
                        default to lowercase).
                    </li>
                    <li><em>sentences | on</em> - The first letter of each sentence should default
                        to a capital letter; all other letters should default to lowercase.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>words</em> - The first letter of each word should default to a capital
                        letter;
                        all other letters should default to lowercase.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>characters</em> - All letters should default to uppercase.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The autocapitalize attribute never causes autocapitalization to be enabled for input
                elements whose type attribute is in one of the URL, Email or Password states.
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>autofocus</strong></dt>
            <dd>The autofocus content attribute allows to indicate an element is to be focused as
                soon as the page is loaded, allowing user to start typing without having to focus
                the element:
                <code>&lt;element <em>autofocus</em>></code>
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>class</strong></dt>
            <dd>The HTML class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element, multiple
                HTML elements can share the same class:
                <code>class=<em>"value"</em></code>
                <br/>The class name is case sensitive, and there are no additional restrictions on
                tokens authors can use, but encouraged to use values that describe the nature of the
                content.
                HTML elements can also belong to more than one class, to define multiple classes,
                separate the class names with a space:
                <code>class=<em>"Name1 Name2 Next-Name"</em></code>
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>contenteditable</strong></dt>
            <dd>The contenteditable attribute specifies whether content of an element is editable or
                not, and is an enumerated attribute whose keywords are true, plaintext-only and
                false:
                <code>contenteditable=<em>"true|plaintext-only|false"</em></code>
                <br/>In addition, there is a fourth state, the inherit state, which is the missing
                value default and the invalid value default.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>true</em> - The true state indicates that the element is editable, an
                        'empty-string' and the true keyword map to the true state.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>plaintext-only</em> - The plaintext-only state indicates that only the
                        element's raw text content is editable, but rich text formatting is
                        disabled.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>false</em> - The false state indicates that the element is not editable,
                        false keyword maps to the false state.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>inherit</em> - The inherit state indicates that the element is the same
                        kind of editable (or not editable) as the parent element.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>data-*</strong></dt>
            <dd>The data-* attributes is used to store custom data private to the page or
                application, it gives the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML
                elements.
                The stored/custom data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more
                engaging user experience (without Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
                Custom attributes prefixed with "data-" will be completely ignored by the user
                agent.
                <br/> The data-* attributes consist of two parts: <code>data-<em>name</em>=<em>"value"</em></code>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>attribute name</em> - The attribute name should not contain any
                        uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix
                        "data-".
                    </li>
                    <li><em>attribute value</em> - The attribute value can be any string.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>dir</strong></dt>
            <dd>The dir attribute specifies the text direction of the element's content, and is an
                enumerated attribute with the following keywords and states:
                <code>dir=<em>"ltr||rtl|auto"</em></code>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>ltr</em> - (Default) The ltr keyword, maps to the ltr state, the
                        contents of the element are explicitly directionally isolated left-to-right
                        text.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>rtl</em> - The rtl keyword, maps to the rtl state, the contents of the
                        element are explicitly directionally isolated right-to-left text.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>auto</em> - The auto keyword, maps to the auto state, the contents of
                        the element are explicitly directionally isolated text.
                        The direction is to be determined programmatically using the contents of the
                        element (only recommended if the text direction is unknown).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Authors are strongly encouraged to use the dir attribute to indicate text direction
                rather than using <em>CSS</em>, that way documents will continue to render correctly
                even in the absence of CSS (e.g. as interpreted by search engines).
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>draggable</strong></dt>
            <dd>The draggable attribute specifies whether an element is draggable or not, an
                enumerated attribute; it has three states, true, false and auto:
                <code>draggable=<em>"auto|true|false"</em></code>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>auto</em> - (Default) The first state is auto; it has no keywords but it
                        is the missing value default and the invalid value default.
                        The auto state uses the default behavior of the user agent (the browser).
                    </li>
                    <li><em>true</em> - The second state is true and it has the keyword true, the
                        true state means the element is draggable.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>false</em> - The third state is false and it has the keyword false, the
                        false state means that the element is not draggable.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                An element with a draggable attribute should also have a <em>title</em> attribute
                that names the element for the purpose of non-visual interactions.
                Links and images are draggable by default, the draggable attribute is often used in
                drag and drop operations (JavaScript API).
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>enterkeyhint</strong></dt>
            <dd>The enterkeyhint content attribute is an enumerated attribute, that specifies what
                action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.
                Allows authors to customize the presentation of the enter key in order to make it
                more helpful for users.
                User agents can support the enterkeyhint attribute on form controls, or in elements
                in an editing host (e.g., using contenteditable):
                <code>enterkeyhint=<em>"enter|done|go|next|previous|search|send"</em></code>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>v</em> - The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'enter',
                        typically inserting a new line.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>done</em> - The user agent should present a cue for the operation
                        'done', typically meaning is nothing more to input and the input method
                        editor (IME) will be closed.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>go</em> - The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'go',
                        typically meaning to take the user to the target of the text they typed.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>next</em> - The user agent should present a cue for the operation
                        'next', typically taking the user to the next field that will accept text.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>previous</em> - The user agent should present a cue for the operation
                        'previous', typically taking the user to the previous field that will accept
                        text.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>search</em> - The user agent should present a cue for the operation
                        'search', typically taking user to the results of searching for the text
                        they have typed.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>send</em> - The user agent should present a cue for the operation
                        'send', typically delivering the text to its target.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>hidden</strong></dt>
            <dd>When specified on an element, indicates the element is not yet, or no longer,
                directly relevant to the page's current state.
                Or that it is being used to declare content to be reused by other parts of the page
                as opposed to being directly accessed by the user.
                The hidden attribute can be used to keep a user from seeing an element until some
                other condition has been met (like selecting a checkbox).
                Then, a JavaScript could remove the hidden attribute, and make the element visible.
                <br/>The hidden attribute is an enumerated attribute, following lists the states for
                this attribute:
                <code>&lt;element <em>hidden</em>></code> | <code>&lt;element hidden=<em>"hidden|until-found"</em>></code>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>hidden</em> - When an element has the hidden attribute in the hidden
                        state, user agents should not render elements.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>until-found</em> - When an element has the hidden attribute in the
                        hidden until found state, the element is hidden but content inside the
                        element will be accessible to find-in-page and fragment navigation.
                        When these features attempt to scroll to a target which is in the element's
                        subtree, the user agent will remove the hidden attribute in order to reveal
                        the content before scrolling to it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Because this attribute is typically implemented using <em>CSS</em>, it's also
                possible to override it using CSS.
                Authors are encouraged to make sure their style sheets don't change the 'display' or
                'content-visibility' properties of hidden until found elements (legacy user agents).
                The for attributes of label and output elements that are not themselves hidden must
                similarly not refer to elements that are hidden;
                such references would cause user confusion.
                Elements and scripts may, however, refer to elements that are hidden in other
                contexts.
            </dd> &emsp;

            <dt><strong>id</strong></dt>
            <dd>The id attribute specifies its element's unique identifier (id), the value of the id
                attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
                Can not have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document:
                <code>id=<em>"value"</em></code>
                <br/>The id name is case sensitive, must contain at least one character, and must
                not contain any space characters (ASCII whitespace).

                Authors should not specify elements as inert unless the content they represent are
                also visually obscured in some way.
                In most cases, authors should not specify the attribute on individual form controls;
                these instances, the disabled attribute probably more appropriate.
                However, for many other situations authors strongly encouraged to clearly mark what
                parts of their document are active and which are inert, to avoid user confusion.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Light dismiss means that pressing Esc key or clicking outside of a popover whose
                popover attribute is in the auto state will close the popover.
                A popover can be useful for rendering a status message, confirming the action
                performed by the user.
                Authors should use the appropriate ARIA attributes to ensure the popover is
                accessible.
                Inserting a popover element into an output element will generally cause screen
                readers to announce the content when it becomes visible.

                Allow or prevent them from being sequentially focusable, and determine their
                relative ordering for sequential focus navigation:
                <code>tabindex=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                <br/>The name "tab index" comes from common use of the Tab key to navigate through
                focusable elements, term "tabbing" refers to moving forward through sequentially
                focusable areas.
                The attribute if specified, must have a value that is a valid integer; the tabbing
                order of the element, 1 is first.
                Positive numbers specify the relative position of the element's focusable areas in
                sequential focus navigation order;
                negative numbers indicate the control is not sequentially focusable.
                Should use caution when using values other than 0 or −1 for their tabindex
                attributes as this is complicated to do correctly.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>omitted or non-integer values</em> - The user agent will decide whether
                        the element is focusable, and if is, whether sequentially focusable, click
                        focusable or both.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>-1 or negative integer values</em> - Causes element to be focusable, and
                        indicates the author would prefer the element to be click focusable but not
                        sequentially focusable.
                        The user agent might ignore this preference for click and sequential
                        focusability, for example;
                        specific element types according to platform conventions or for
                        keyboard-only users.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>0 </em> - Causes element to be focusable, and indicates author would
                        prefer element to be both click focusable and sequentially focusable.
                        The user agent might ignore this preference for click and sequential
                        focusability.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>positive integer values</em> - Behaves same as 0, but in addition
                        creates a relative ordering within a tabindex-ordered focus navigation
                        scope, so elements with higher value come later.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The tabindex attribute cannot be used to make an element non-focusable, can do that
                by disabling element, or making it inert.

            <dd>The title attribute represents advisory information or extra information for the
                element, such as would be appropriate for a tooltip.
                The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the
                element:
                <code>title=<em>"value"</em></code>
                <br/>On a link, could be the title or a description of the target resource, an image
                the image credit or a description of the image, a paragraph a footnote or commentary
                on the text.
                Relying on the title attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not
                expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by specification.
                For example, requiring a pointing device, which excludes keyboard-only users and
                touch-only users.
                If this attribute is omitted from an element, it implies the title attribute of the
                nearest ancestor HTML element with a title attribute set;
                setting the attribute overrides this.
                If the title attribute's value contains line feed (LF) characters, the content is
                split into multiple lines.
                Setting the attribute to the empty string indicates the element has no advisory
                information.

                <ul>
                    <li><em>yes</em> - The empty string and the yes keyword map to the yes state,
                        specifies that the content of the element should be translated.
                        When an element is in the translate-enabled state, the element's
                        translatable attributes and the values of its Text node children are to be
                        translated when the page is localized.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>no</em> - The no keyword maps to the no state, specifies that the
                        content of the element must not be translated.
                        When an element is in the no-translate state, the element's attribute values
                        and values of its Text node children are to be left as-is when page is
                        localized.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>inherit</em> - In addition, there is a third state, the inherit state,
                        which is the missing value default and the invalid value default.
                        The element's translation mode is in the same state as its parent element's,
                        if any.

    <h3>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</h3>
    <p>A screen reader is a software program that reads the HTML code, and allows the user to
        "listen" to the content.
        Screen readers are useful for people who are visually impaired or learning disabled.
        To enable assistive technology to expose a more fine-grained interface, a set of annotations
        for assistive technology products can be specified;
        the <em>ARIA <b>role</b> and <b>aria-*</b> attributes</em>.
        The role attribute is defined in <em>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</em>; in
        addition with the aria-* content attributes.

        <h2>Main Elements</h2>
        <h3>document Element - &lt;!DOCTYPE> </h3>
        <p>HTML documents must start with &lt;!DOCTYPE>, the declaration is not an HTML tag, it is
            information to the browser about what document type to expect.
            It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags);
            if omitted browsers tend to use a different rendering mode incompatible with some
            specifications.
            Every HTML document is represented by a <strong>Document Object</strong>; the Document
            object's origin is defined in <em><b>DOM</b></em>.
            The declaration not case sensitive, in HTML5, the declaration is: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE
                html></code>
        <ul>
            <li>Each Document has a policy container, initially a new policy container, which
                contains policies which apply to the Document.
            </li>
            <li>Each Document has a permissions policy, which is initially empty.
            </li>
            <li>Each Document has a module map, which is initially empty.
            </li>
            <li>Each Document has a cross-origin opener policy, which is initially a new
                cross-origin opener policy.
            </li>
            <li>Each Document has a navigation id, which is initially null.
            </li>
        </ul>
        In older documents, the declaration is more complicated because the declaration must refer
        to a DTD (Document Type Definition):
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"></code> - <i>HTML 4.01</i>
        </p>

        <h3>html Element - &lt;html> </h3>
        <p>The html element represents the root of an HTML document, the tag is the container for
            all other HTML elements (except <em>&lt;!DOCTYPE></em>);
            it is what the HTML document itself begins with.
            Authors are encouraged to specify a <em>lang</em> attribute on the root html element,
            giving the document's language.
            This is meant to assist <i>search engines, browsers and aids speech synthesis or
                translation tools</i> to determine what pronunciation or rules to use:
            <code>&lt;html <em>lang="en"</em>></code> - Declares the document's language is English.
            <br/>See all the language codes in the <a target="_blank"

                ISO Language Code Reference</a>.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>html Attributes</em></b></summary>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>xmlns</strong></dt>
                <dd>Specifies the XML namespace attribute, if need content to conform to XHTML.
                    The namespace <em>"xmlns=http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</em> is default, and will
                    be added to the html tag even if you do not include it.
                </dd>
            </dl>

        <h3>head Element - &lt;head> </h3>
        <p>The head element is used as the first element in an html element, and represents a
            container/collection of <em>metadata</em> for the Document (data about data).
            <strong>Metadata</strong> is data about the HTML document, it is not displayed and
            typically defines the document <i>title, character set, styles, scripts and other meta
                information</i>. []
        </p>

        <h3>title Element - &lt;title> </h3>
        <p>The title element represents the document's title or name, the title must be text-only,
            and is shown in the browser's title bar or page's tab.
            There must be no more than one title element per document: <code>&lt;title><em>A
                Meaningful Page-Title</em>&lt;/title></code>
            <br/>Authors should use titles that identify their documents even when they are used out
            of context, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible.
            If it's reasonable for the Document to have no title, then the title element is probably
            not required.
            The title element provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites and
            displays a title for the page in search engine-results.
            The content of a page title very important for <em>search engine optimization (SEO)</em>,
            and is used by search engine algorithms to decide order when listing pages in search
            results.
        </p>

        <h3>body Element - &lt;body> </h3>
        <p>The body element contains and represents all contents of an HTML document, the tag
            defines the visible part of the document's body.
            It contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as <i>headings, paragraphs,
                images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc</i>.
            There can only be one body element in an HTML document:
            <i>See the <a target="_blank" href="HTML.html#sample_html">Sample HTML</a> example on
                the sites Main webpage.</i>

        </p>

        <h3>HTML Comments</h3>
        <p>The comment tag is used to insert comments in the <em>source code</em>, HTML comments are
            not displayed in browsers;
            but can help document the HTML source code.
            You can add comments to HTML source code, by using the following syntax: <code> &lt;!--
                <em>This is an HTML comment</em> --> </code>
            - Notice there is an <em>exclamation point (<b>!</b>)</em> in the <em>start tag</em>,
            but not in the end tag.
            Place <i>notifications and reminders</i> in HTML code, or explain code, which can help
            to edit it later;
            this is especially useful if you have a lot of code.
            Comments can also be used to hide content, and they can hide parts in the middle of the
            HTML code.
            You can even hide more than one line, everything between the comment tag will be hidden
            from the display.
            Thus, comments are great for <em><b>Debugging</b></em> HTML, because you can comment out
            any HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In particular, familiarity with the basics of <strong>DOM</strong> is
        necessary for a complete understanding of some of the more technical parts.
        An understanding of <em>Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript and
            CSS</em> will also be helpful in places but is not essential.
