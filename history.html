    <h2>The History of HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML, its supporting <em>DOM APIs</em>, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have
        been developed over a period of several decades. This has been done by a wide array of
        people with different priorities who, in many cases, did not know of each other's existence.
        Since the early days of the World Wide Web, there have been many versions of HTML:

        <p>
            For its first five years, from 1990-1995, HTML went through a number of revisions and
            experienced a number of extensions. It was primarily hosted first at the <em>
            European
            Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
        </em>, and then at the <em>
            Internet Engineering
            Task Force (IETF)
        </em>.
            Then, with the creation of the <em>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</em>, HTML's
            development
            changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at extending HTML in 1995 known as
            <strong>
                HTML
                3.0
            </strong>, then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as <strong>
            HTML
            3.2
        </strong>.
            This was completed in 1997, witch then saw <strong>HTML4</strong> quickly follow later
            that
            same year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following year, the <em>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</em> membership decided to
            stop
            evolving HTML. And instead begin work on an <em>XML-based</em> equivalent, called
            <strong>XHTML</strong>.
            This effort started with a reformulation of <i>HTML4 in XML</i>, known as <strong>
            XHTML
            1.0
        </strong>. This added no new features except the new serialization, and was completed
            in 2000.
            After XHTML 1.0, the <em>W3C</em>'s focus turned to making it easier for other working
            groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of <em>XHTML Modularization</em>. In parallel
            with
            this, the <em>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</em> also worked on a new language, not
            compatible with earlier <em>HTML and XHTML</em> languages, calling it
            <strong>XHTML2</strong>.
            Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML
            developed by browser vendors were specified and published under the name <strong>
            DOM Level
            1
        </strong> in 1998. And then <strong>DOM Level 2 Core</strong> and <strong>
            DOM Level 2
            HTML
        </strong>, starting in 2000 and then culminating in 2003.
            These efforts then petered out, with some <strong>DOM Level 3</strong> specifications
            published in 2004, but the working group being closed before all the <i>Level 3
            drafts</i>
            were completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2003, the publication of <em>XForms</em>, a technology positioned as the next
            generation
            of web forms, sparked renewed interest in evolving HTML itself (rather than finding
            replacements). This interest was from realization <em>XML</em>'s deployment as a web
            technology, was limited to new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than a
            replacement for existing technologies.
            A proof of concept to show it was possible to extend <em>HTML4's forms</em> to provide
            many
            of the features <em>XForms 1.0</em> introduced, was the first result of this renewed
            interest. This was without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were
            incompatible with existing HTML web pages.
            At this early stage, while the draft was publicly available, and input already being
            solicited from all sources, the specification was only under <em>Opera Software's</em>
            copyright.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a <em>
            World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C)
        </em> workshop in 2004. Here some principles that underlie
            <strong>HTML5</strong> work, as well as the early draft proposal covering just
            forms-related
            features, were presented to the <em>W3C</em> jointly by <em>Mozilla and Opera</em>.
            The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the
            previously
            chosen direction for the web's evolution. The <em>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</em>
            staff
            and membership, voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.
            Shortly thereafter, <em>Apple, Mozilla and Opera</em>, jointly announced intent to
            continue
            working on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue, called the <em>
            Web Hypertext
            Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
        </em>. A public mailing list was created,
            and the draft was moved to the <em>
            Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
            (WHATWG)
        </em> site.
            The copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly owned by all three vendors, and to
            allow reuse of the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>WHATWG</em> was based on several core principles, in particular that
            technologies
            need to be backwards compatible. Also, that specifications and implementations, need to
            match even if this means changing the specification rather than the implementations.
            And, that specifications need to be detailed enough that implementations, can achieve
            complete interoperability without reverse-engineering each other. The latter requirement
            in
            particular required the scope of the <strong>HTML5</strong> specification, include what
            had
            previously been specified in three separate documents: <em>HTML4, XHTML1 and DOM2
            HTML</em>.
            It also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered
            the
            norm.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2006, the <em>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</em> indicated an interest to
            participate in
            the development of HTML5 after all. And, in 2007 formed a working group chartered to
            work
            with the <em>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</em> on the
            development of the HTML5 specification.
            <em>Apple, Mozilla and Opera</em> allowed the <em>W3C</em> to publish the specification
            under the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on
            the
            <em>WHATWG</em> site.
            <br/>For a number of years, both groups then worked together, in 2011, however, the
            groups
            came to the conclusion that they had different goals: The <em>W3C</em> wanted to publish
            a
            "finished" version of "HTML5". The <em>WHATWG</em> wanted to continue working on a
            Living
            Standard for HTML.
            And maintaining the specification rather than freezing it in a state with known
            problems,
            and adding new features as needed to evolve the platform.
            <br/>In 2019, the <em>WHATWG and W3C</em> signed an agreement to collaborate on a single
            version of HTML going forward: <em>The current specification</em>.

        <h3>HTML Character Sets - From ASCII to UTF-8</h3>
        <p>
            The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the <strong>UTF-8</strong>
            character set, but this has not always been the case.
            Computer data is stored as binary codes (01000101) in the electronics.
            The character encoding for the early web was <em><b>ASCII</b></em>, and it was the first
            character encoding standard.
            To standardize the storing of text, the <em><b>American Standard Code for Information
            Interchange</b> (ASCII)</em> was created.
            ASCII was the first character set (encoding standard) used between computers on the
            Internet.
            The character sets used in modern computers, in HTML, and on the Internet, are all based
            on <em>ASCII</em>.
            ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet, it defined a
            unique binary number for each storable character.
            This was to support numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case alphabet and special
            characters (like <i>! $ + - ( ) @ < > , .</i>).
            Since ASCII used 7 bits for the character, it could only represent 128 different
            characters; it's biggest weakness however, was it excluded non English letters.
            ASCII is still in use today, especially in large mainframe computer systems -
            <i>See the <a target="_blank"
                          href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp">Complete
                ASCII Reference</a></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, from <i>HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01</i>, <strong>ISO-8859-1</strong> was considered as
            the standard character set, and was the default character set for HTML 4.
            This character set supported 256 different character codes, and is an extension to <em>ASCII</em>;
            with added international characters.
            The <em><b>International Standards Organization</b> (ISO)</em> defines the standard
            character sets, for different alphabets and languages -
            <i>See the <a target="_blank"
                          href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_8859.asp">Complete
                ISO-8859-1 Reference</a></i>
            <br/>For Windows, <em><b>ANSI</b> (Windows-1252)</em> was the original character set,
            and is identical to <em>ISO-8859-1</em>; but also has 32 extra characters.
            Windows-1252 was the default character set in Windows, up to Windows 95, and is an
            extension to <em>ASCII</em>; with added international characters.
            Historically, the term "ANSI Code Pages" was used in Windows to refer to non-DOS
            character sets.
            The intention was that these character sets would be ANSI standards like ISO-8859-1.
            It uses a full byte (8-bits) to represent 256 different characters, and has been the
            default in Windows; it is supported by all browsers.
            Even though Windows-1252 is almost identical to <em>ISO-8859-1</em>, it has never been
            an <em>ANSI or ISO standard</em> -
            <i>See the <a target="_blank"
                          href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ansi.asp">Complete
                Windows-1252 Reference</a></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            With <em><b>XML</b> and <b>HTML5</b></em>, <strong>UTF-8</strong> finally arrived and
            solved a lot of character encoding problems.
            The <em>Unicode Consortium</em> developed the <em><b>UTF-8</b> and <b>UTF-16</b></em>
            standards, because <em>ISO-8859</em> character-sets are limited, and not a compatible
            multilingual environment.
            UTF-8 is also built on <em>ASCII</em>, the <em><b>Unicode Standard</b></em> covers
            almost all of the <i>characters, punctuations and symbols</i> in the world.
            All HTML 4 processors support UTF-8, and all HTML5 and XML processors support UTF-8,
            UTF-16, Windows-1252 and ISO-8859.
            The Unicode Standard has become a success and is implemented in <i>HTML, XML, Java,
            JavaScript, E-mail, ASP, PHP, etc</i>.
            The Unicode Consortium goal, is to replace the existing character sets with its standard
            <em><b>Unicode Transformation Format</b> (UTF)</em>.
            The Unicode standard is also supported in many operating systems and all modern
            browsers.
            The Unicode Consortium cooperates with the leading standards development organizations,
            like <i>ISO, W3C and ECMA</i> -
