    <section><h2>Tables</h2>
        <p>HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into <i>rows, columns and cells</i>
            inside of a &lt;table> element;
            the rows and columns form a grid.
            Each table row starts with a new &lt;tr> element, "tr" stands for table row.
            You can also add a caption that serves as a heading for the entire table, to add a
            caption to a table, use the &lt;caption> tag.
            The &lt;caption> tag should be inserted immediately after the &lt;table> tag.
        <ul><strong>An HTML table has two kinds of cells:</strong>
            <li><strong>Header cells</strong> - Contains header information, and is created with a
                &lt;th> element;
                "th" stands for table header.
                Sometimes you want cells to be table header cells, by default, the text in &lt;th>
                elements are bold and centered (can change that with <em>CSS</em>).
                To use the first column as table headers, define the first cell in each row with a
                &lt;th> element.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data cells</strong> - Contains data created with a &lt;td> element, "td"
                stands for table data;
                the text in &lt;td> elements are regular and left-aligned by default.
                The table data elements are data containers of the table, they can contain all sorts
                of HTML elements;
                <i>text, images, lists, other tables etc</i>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>HTML tables can also have cells that span over multiple rows and/or columns, and can use
            <em>CSS properties</em> such as:
            <em>borders, color, size, padding, etc</em>.
            In visual media, providing column and row borders, as well as alternating row
            backgrounds;
            can be very an effective way to make complicated tables more readable.
            The &lt;colgroup> element is used to style specific columns of a table, each group is
            specified with a &lt;col> element.
            There is a very limited selection of legal CSS properties for colgroups.
            <br/>Any table in general, where the reader might have difficulty understanding content,
            authors should include explanatory information introducing the table.
            This information is useful for all users, but especially for users who cannot see the
            table (e.g. users of screen readers).
            Such explanatory information should introduce the purpose of the table, outline its cell
            structure, highlight trends or patterns and teach how to use the table.
        </p>

        <h4>table Element - &lt;table></h4>
        <p>Element represents data with more than one dimension, in the form of a table.
            Tables have rows, columns and cells given by their descendants, their rows and columns
            form a grid.
            An HTML table consists of one &lt;table> element and one or more table row &lt;tr>,
            table header &lt;th> and table data &lt;td> elements.
            Authors are encouraged to provide information describing how to interpret complex
            tables.
            You can add a caption that serves as a heading for the entire table, using the &lt;caption>
            tag.
        </p>

        <h4>caption Element - &lt;caption></h4>
        <p>Element represents a title of the table (a table caption) that is its parent, if it has a
            parent &lt;table> element;
            it must be inserted immediately after the &lt;table> tag.
            A caption can introduce context for a table, making it significantly easier to
            understand;
            by default, a table caption will be center-aligned above a table.
        </p>

        <h4>tr Element - &lt;tr></h4>
        <p>Element defines a row of cells in a table, a &lt;tr> element contains one or more &lt;th>
            or &lt;td> elements.
        </p>

        <h4>th element - &lt;th></h4>
        <p>Element defines a header cell in a table, elements are bold and centered by default.

                    header cells the header cell is related to: <code>&lt;headers=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                    - The headers attribute has no visual effect in ordinary web browsers, but can
                    be used by screen readers.

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>scope</strong></dt>
                <dd>The scope attribute is an enumerated attribute with five states, four of which
                    have explicit keywords.
                    This specifies whether a header cell is a header for a column, row, or group of
                    columns and rows.
                    The scope attribute has no visual effect in ordinary web browsers, but can be
                    used by screen readers:
                    <code>&lt;scope=<em>"auto|col|row|colgroup|rowgroup"</em>></code>
                    { <em>auto</em> - (Default) The scope attribute's missing value default and
                    invalid value default are the auto state.
                    The auto state makes the header cell apply to a set of cells selected based on
                    context.
                    | <em>col</em> - The col keyword, maps to the column state, the column state
                    means the header cell applies to some of the subsequent cells in the same
                    column(s).
                    | <em>row</em> - The row state means the header cell applies to some of the
                    subsequent cells in the same row(s).
                    | <em>colgroup</em> - The colgroup keyword, maps to the column group state, the
                    column group state means the header cell applies to all remaining cells in the
                    column group.
                    A th element's scope attribute must not be in the column group state if the
                    element is not anchored in a column group.
                    | <em>rowgroup</em> - The rowgroup keyword, maps to the row group state, the row
                    group state means the header cell applies to all remaining cells in the row
                    group.
                    A &lt;th> element's scope attribute must not be in the row group state if the
                    element is not anchored in a row group. }

            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>abbr</strong></dt>
                <dd>The abbr attribute specifies an abbreviated version of the content in a header
                    cell, when referencing the cell in other contexts.
                    It is typically an abbreviated form of the full header cell, but can also be an
                    expansion, or merely a different phrasing: <code>&lt;th
                        abbr=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                    - The abbr attribute has no visual effect in ordinary web browsers, but can be
                    used by screen readers.

        <h4>td Element - &lt;td></h4>
        <p>Element defines a data cell in a table, and can contain all sorts of HTML elements, such
            as:
            <i>text, images, lists, other tables, etc</i>.
            The text in &lt;td> elements are regular and left-aligned by default.

                    - If the value is colspan="0", this tells the browser to span the cell to the
                    last column of the column group (colgroup)
                    - Only Firefox supports colspan="0".

        </p>

        <h4>thead Element - &lt;thead></h4>
        <p>Element represents a block of rows that consist of the column labels (it groups the
            column headers) for the parent &lt;table> element, if has a parent and it is a table.
            The element is used in conjunction with the &lt;tbody> and &lt;tfoot> elements, to
            specify each part of a table (header, body, footer).
            Browsers can use these elements, to enable scrolling of the table body independently of
            the header and footer.
            Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages, these elements can enable
            the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.
            The &lt;thead> element must have one or more &lt;tr> tags inside, and be used in the
            following context:
            <i>As a child of a &lt;table> element, after any &lt;caption> or &lt;colgroup> elements,
                and before any &lt;tbody>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tr> elements.</i>
        </p>

        <h4>tbody Element - &lt;tbody></h4>
        <p>Element represents a block of rows, that consist of a body of data for the parent &lt;table>
            element
            (it groups the body content in a table), if it has a parent and it is a table.
            The element is used in conjunction with the &lt;thead> and &lt;tfoot> elements, to
            specify each part of a table (body, header, footer).
            Browsers can use these elements, to enable scrolling of the table body independently of
            the header and footer.
            Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages, these elements can enable
            the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.
            The &lt;tbody> element must have one or more &lt;tr> tags inside, and be used in the
            following context:
            <i>As a child of a &lt;table> element, after any &lt;caption>, &lt;colgroup> and &lt;thead>
                elements.</i>
        </p>

        <h4>tfoot Element - &lt;tfoot></h4>
        <p>Element represents block of rows that consist of the column summaries (it groups the
            footer content) for parent &lt;table> element, if has a parent and is a table.
            The &lt;tfoot> element is used in conjunction with the &lt;thead> and &lt;tbody>
            elements, to specify each part of a table (footer, header, body).
            Browsers can use these elements, to enable scrolling of the table body independently of
            the header and footer.
            Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages, these elements can enable
            the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.
            The &lt;tfoot> element must have one or more &lt;tr> tags inside, and must be used in
            the following context:
            <i>As a child of a &lt;table> element, after any &lt;caption>, &lt;colgroup>, &lt;thead>
                and &lt;tbody> elements.</i>
        </p>

        <h4>colgroup Element - &lt;colgroup></h4>
        <p>Element represents a group of one or more columns in the table (for formatting) that is
            its parent, if it has a parent and that is a &lt;table> element.
            The &lt;colgroup> tag must be a child of a &lt;table> element, after any &lt;caption>
            elements and before any &lt;thead>, &lt;tbody>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tr> elements.
            The tag is useful for applying styles to entire columns, instead of repeating the styles
            for each cell or each row.
            To define different properties to a column within a colgroup, use the &lt;col> tag
            within the &lt;colgroup> element: <code>&lt;colgroup> &lt;col <em>span="2"
                style="property:value"</em>> &lt;/colgroup></code>
            - If you want to style more columns with different styles, use more &lt;col> elements
            inside the &lt;colgroup> tag.
            If a colgroup contains no &lt;col> elements, then may have a <em>span</em> attribute
            specified, whose value must be a non-negative integer greater than zero and less than or
            equal to 1000.

        </p>

        <h4>col Element - &lt;col></h4>
        <p>Element specifies column properties for each column within a &lt;colgroup> element.
            If the element has a parent &lt;colgroup> element, with a parent &lt;table> element, the
            &lt;col> element represents one or more columns in the column group.

    <section><h2>HTML Forms</h2>
        <p>An HTML form is used to collect user input, most often this is sent to a server for
            processing.
            A form is a component of a web page that has <em><b>form controls</b></em>, such as <i>text,
                buttons, checkboxes, range or color picker controls</i>.
            Writing a form consists of several steps, which can be performed in any order:
            <em>writing the user interface, implementing server-side processing and configuring user
                interface to communicate with the server</em>.
            Any form starts with a &lt;form> element, inside which are placed the controls;
            the &lt;form> element can contain one or more of the following form elements:
            &lt;input>, &lt;textarea>, &lt;button>, &lt;select>, &lt;option>, &lt;optgroup>, &lt;fieldset>,
            &lt;label or &lt;output>
            - Many of these form controls have attributes to control exactly what values can be
            specified.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most controls are represented by the &lt;input> element, which by default provides a
            text control;
            the &lt;input> element is the most used form element.
            An &lt;input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the <em>type</em>
            attribute.
            And each input field must have a <em>name</em> attribute to be submitted, if the
            attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.
            Multiple controls can have the same name, the server distinguishes for example, which
            checkbox was checked by seeing which values are submitted with that name.
            To label a control, the &lt;label> element is used; the label text and the control
            itself go inside of the &lt;label> element.
            The &lt;label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will
            read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.
            To group a batch of controls together, such as, radio buttons, one can use the &lt;fieldset>
            element.
            The title of such a group of controls is given by the first element in the fieldset,
            which has to be a &lt;legend> element.
        </p>

        <h4>form element - &lt;form></h4>
        <p>Element defines an HTML form for user input, and is a container for different types of

                    <br/>In theory, any character encoding can be used, but no browser understands
                    all of them.
                    The more widely a character encoding is used, the better the chance that a
                    browser will understand it.
                    <ul><strong>Common values:</strong>
                        <li><em>UTF-8</em> - Character encoding for Unicode.</li>

        <h4>input Element - &lt;input></h4>
        <p>Element defines an input control (input field), where the user can enter data; it is the
            most important/used form element.
            The input element represents a "typed" data field, usually with a form control to allow
            the user to edit the data.
            But it can also be displayed in several ways depending on the <em>type</em> attribute,
            witch controls the data type
            (and associated control) of the element; it is an enumerated attribute.

                            tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"color"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>date</em> - The input element represents a control for setting the
                            element's value to a string representing a specific date
                            (a date picker), resulting value includes the year, month and day.
                            The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that
                            is a valid date string.
                            The step attribute is expressed in days, the default step is 1 day;
                            and min or max attributes, must also have a value that is a valid date
                            string.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"date"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>datetime-local</em> - The input element represents a control for
                            setting the element's value to a string representing a local date and
                            time, with no time-zone offset information
                            (a date picker - year, month, day and time).
                            The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that
                            is a valid local date and time string.
                            The step attribute is expressed in seconds, default step is 60 seconds;
                            and the min and max attributes, if specified, must have a value that is
                            a valid local date and time string.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"datetime-local"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>email</em> - The input element represents a control/field for
                            editing an email address given in the element's value.
                            The value attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid
                            email address list.
                            The input value is automatically validated to ensure it is a properly
                            formatted e-mail address.
                            To define an e-mail field that allows multiple e-mail addresses, add the
                            "multiple" attribute.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"email"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>file</em> - The input element represents a list of selected files,
                            each file consisting of a filename, a file type and a file body (the
                            contents of the file).
                            It defines a file-select field and a "Browse" button for file uploads,
                            to define a file-select field that allows multiple files to be selected,
                            add the multiple attribute.
                            The accept attribute may be specified to provide user agents with a hint
                            of what file types will be accepted.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"file"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>hidden</em> - The input element represents a value that is not
                            intended to be examined or manipulated by the user, it defines a hidden
                            input field.
                            A hidden field lets web developers include data that cannot be seen or
                            modified by users when a form is submitted.
                            If the name attribute is present and has a value that is an ASCII
                            case-insensitive match for "_charset_", the element's value attribute
                            must be omitted.
                            A hidden field often stores what database record that needs to be
                            updated when the form is submitted, do not use hidden inputs as a form
                            of security.
                            While the value not displayed to user in the page's content, it is
                            visible and can be edited using any browser's developer tools or "View
                            Source" functionality.
                            The autocomplete content attribute applies to this element: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"hidden"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>image</em> - The input element represents either an image from which
                            a user can select a coordinate and submit the form, or a button from
                            which the user can submit the form.
                            The element is a button, specifically an image as the submit button; the
                            image is given by the src attribute, and supports dimension attributes.
                            The coordinate is sent to the server during form submission by sending
                            two entries for the element.
                            Are derived from the name of the control but with ".x" and ".y" appended
                            to the name with the x and y components of the coordinate respectively.
                            The alt attribute provides the textual label for the button for users
                            and user agents who cannot use the image, the alt attribute must be
                            present: <code>&lt;input type=<em>"image"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>month</em> - The input element represents a control for setting the
                            element's value to a string representing a specific month, the format is
                            "YYYY-MM" (no timezone).
                            The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that
                            is a valid month string.
                            The step attribute is expressed in months, default step is 1 month; and
                            min and max attributes, if specified, must have a value that is a valid
                            month string.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"month"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>number</em> - The input element represents a control/field for
                            setting the element's value to a string representing a number.
                            The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that
                            is a valid floating-point number.
                            The min or max attributes, if specified, must have a value that is a
                            valid floating-point number.
                            The default step is 1, allowing only integers to be selected by the
                            user, unless the step base has a non-integer value.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"number"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>password</em> - The input element represents a one line plain text
                            edit control for the element's value (a password field).
                            The user agent should obscure the value so that people other than the
                            user cannot see it.
                            The value attribute, if specified, must have a value that contains no
                            Line Feed (LF) or Carriage Return (CR) characters.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"password"</em>></code>
                            - Any forms involving sensitive information like passwords should be
                            served over HTTPS.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>radio</em> - The input element represents a control that, when used
                            with other input elements, forms a radio button group in which only one
                            control can have its checkedness state set to true.
                            If the element's checkedness state is true, the control represents the
                            selected control in the group.
                            And if it is false, it indicates a control in the group that is not
                            selected.
                            Radio buttons are normally presented in radio groups, witch is a
                            collection of radio buttons describing a set of related options.
                            Only one radio button in a group can be selected at the same time, the
                            radio group must have share the same name (the value of the name
                            attribute) to be treated as a group.
                            Once the radio group is created, selecting any radio button in that
                            group automatically deselects any other selected radio button in the
                            same group.
                            The value attribute defines the unique value associated with each radio
                            button.
                            The value is not shown to the user, but is the value that is sent to the
                            server on "submit" to identify which radio button that was selected.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"radio"</em>></code>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>range</em> - The input element represents a control for setting the
                            element's value to a string representing a number, it defines a range
                            control (like a slider control):
                            <code>&lt;input type=<em>"range"</em>></code> - Default range is 0 to
                            100, however, you can set restrictions on what numbers are accepted with
                            attributes:
                            { <em>max</em> - The max attribute specifies the maximum value allowed,
                            use the max attribute with the min attribute to create a range of legal
                            values.
                            The max attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid
                            floating-point number; default maximum is 100.
                            | <em>min</em> - The min attribute specifies the minimum value for
                            allowed, use the min attribute with the max attribute to create a range
                            of legal values.
                            The min attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid
                            floating-point number; default minimum is 0.
                            | <em>value</em> - The value attribute, if specified, must have a value
                            that is a valid floating-point number;
                            this specifies the default value.
                            The default value is the minimum plus half the difference between the
                            minimum and the maximum, if the maximum is less than the minimum, the
                            default value is the minimum.
                            | <em>step</em> - The step attribute specifies the interval between
                            legal numbers in an input element, default step is 1;
                            allowing only integers, unless min attribute has a non-integer value.
                            For example, if step="3", legal numbers could be -3, 0, 3, 6, etc.
                            The step attribute can be used with the max and min attributes to create
                            a range of legal values. }
                        </li>
                        <li><em>reset</em> - The input element represents a button that, when
                            activated, resets all form values;
                            the element is a button (a reset button): <code>&lt;input type=<em>"reset"</em>></code>
                            - Avoid reset buttons in forms, it is frustrating for users if they
                            click them by mistake.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>search</em> - The input element represents a one line plain text
                            edit control for the element's value (search string).
                            Remember to set a name for the search field, otherwise nothing will be
                            submitted; the most common name for search inputs is q: <code>&lt;input
                                type=<em>"search"</em>></code>
                            - The value attribute, if specified, must have a value that contains no
                            Line Feed (LF) or Carriage Return (CR) characters.
                            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>submit</em> - The input element represents a button that, when
                            activated, submits form values to a form-handler;
                            the element is a button, specifically a submit button.
                            The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing
                            the input data, the form-handler is specified in the form's action
                            attribute:
                            <code>&lt;input type=<em>"submit"</em>></code> - The formnovalidate
                            attribute can be used to make submit buttons that do not trigger the
                            constraint validation.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>tel</em> - The input element represents a control for editing and
                            entering a telephone number given in the element's value.
                            Browsers that do not support "tel" fall back to being a standard "text"
                            input: <code>&lt;input type=<em>"tel"</em>></code>
                            - Always the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>time</em> - The input element represents a control for setting the
                            element's value to a string representing a specific time
                            (no timezone): <code>&lt;input type=<em>"time"</em>></code>
                            - The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value
                            that is a valid time string.
                            The min and max attributes, if specified, must have a value that is a

        <h4>label Element - &lt;label></h4>
        <p>Element represents a caption in a user interface, the caption can be associated with a
            specific form control.
            A label can also be bound to an element by placing the element inside of the &lt;label>
            element.
            The tag defines a label for several elements: &lt;input type="value">, &lt;meter>, &lt;progress>,
            &lt;select> or &lt;textarea>.
            It is useful for screen-reader users, because it will read loud the label when user
            focus on the input element.
            It is also useful for users who have difficulty clicking on small regions (such as
            checkboxes).

        <h4>search Element - &lt;search></h4>
        <p>Element represents a part of a document or application that contains a set of form
            controls, or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation.
            This could be a search of the web site or application, a way of searching or filtering
            search results on the current web page, or a global or Internet-wide search function.
            It's not appropriate to use the &lt;search> element just for presenting search results,
            though suggestions and links as part of "quick search" results can be included as part
            of a search feature.

        <h4>meter Element - &lt;meter></h4>
        <p>Element defines a scalar measurement within a known range or a fractional value (such as
            disk usage), also known as a 'gauge'.
            Authors are encouraged to include a textual representation of the gauge's state in the
            element's contents, for user agents that do not support the &lt;meter> element.
            The element should not be used to indicate progress (as in a progress bar), for that
            role, HTML provides a separate &lt;progress> element.
            The meter element also does not represent a scalar value of arbitrary range, it would be
            wrong to use this to report weight or height, unless is a known maximum value.
            Always add the &lt;label> tag for best accessibility practices.

                    <code>&lt;select size=<em>number</em>></code>
                    - In Chrome and Safari, this attribute may not work as expected for size="2" and
                    size="3".

        <h4>option Element - &lt;option></h4>
        <p>Element represents an option in a &lt;select> element, or as part of a list of
            suggestions in a &lt;datalist> element;
            by default the first item in the drop-down list is selected.
            The &lt;option> element(s) go inside of a &lt;select>, &lt;optgroup> or &lt;datalist>
            element;
            if have a long list of options, group related options within the &lt;optgroup> tag.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>option Attributes</em></b> - The element can be used without any
                attributes, but usually needs the <em>value</em> attribute; which indicates what is
                sent to the server on form submission.
            </summary>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>disabled</strong></dt>
                <dd>The disabled attribute is a boolean attribute, it specifies that an option
                    should be disabled;
                    a disabled option is unusable and un-clickable.
                    An option element is disabled if its disabled attribute is present, or if it is
                    a child of an optgroup element whose disabled attribute is present:
                    <code>&lt;option <em>disabled</em>></code>

            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>label</strong></dt>
                <dd>The label attribute provides a label for element, the label of an option element
                    is the value of the label content attribute.
                    The attribute specifies a shorter version of an option; the shorter version will
                    be displayed in the drop-down list:
                    <code>&lt;option label <em>"value"</em>></code>

                <dt><strong>selected</strong></dt>
                <dd>The selected attribute is a boolean attribute, it specifies an option should be
                    pre-selected when the page loads (selected by default).
                    The pre-selected option will be displayed first in the drop-down list, the
                    selected attribute can also be set after the page loads, with a JavaScript.
                    A select element whose multiple attribute is not specified, must not have more
                    than one descendant option element with its selected attribute set:
                    <code>&lt;option <em>selected</em>></code>

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>value</strong></dt>
                <dd>The value attribute provides a value for element, and specifies the value to be
                    sent to a server (value used for form submission).
                    If the value attribute is not specified, the content will be passed as a value
                    instead: <code>&lt;option value=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </details>
        </p>

        <h4>optgroup Element - &lt;optgroup></h4>
        <p>Element represents a group of &lt;option> elements with a common label, it is used to
            group related options in a &lt;select> element (a drop-down list).
            Element's group of &lt;option> elements consists of the &lt;option> elements, that are
            children of the &lt;optgroup> element.
            If you have a long list of options, groups of related options are easier to handle for a
            user.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>optgroup Attributes</em></b> - The <em>label</em> attribute must be

        </details>
        </p>

        <h4>datalist Element - &lt;datalist></h4>
        <p>Element represents a set of &lt;option> elements, that represent predefined options for
            other controls (input controls).
            Element is hooked up to input using the <em>list</em> attribute on the &lt;input>
            element, users see a drop-down list of pre-defined options as they input data.
            The &lt;datalist> tag is used to provide an "autocomplete" feature for &lt;input>
            elements.
            Element can be used in two ways, the simplest case, the &lt;datalist> element has just
            &lt;option> element children.
            The more elaborate, the element can be given contents to be displayed for down-level
            clients that don't support the &lt;datalist> tag.
            This case, &lt;option> elements are provided inside a &lt;select> element inside of the
            &lt;datalist> element.
            Each &lt;option> element that is a descendant of the &lt;datalist> element, is not
            disabled, and whose value is a string that is empty;
            represents a suggestion, each has a value and label.
            The &lt;datalist> element's <em>id</em> attribute must be equal to the &lt;input>
            element's <em>list</em> attributel; this will bind them together.
        </p>

        <h4>fieldset Element - &lt;fieldset></h4>
        <p>Element represents a set of form controls or other content, grouped together, and will
            draw a box around the related elements; optionally with a caption.
            The caption is given by the first &lt;legend> element that is a child of the &lt;fieldset>
            element, the remainder of descendants form the group.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>fieldset Attributes</em></b></summary>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>disabled</strong></dt>
                <dd>The disabled attribute is a boolean attribute, it specifies that a group of
                    related form elements (a fieldset) should be disabled.
                    Excluding those that are descendants of the &lt;fieldset> element's first legend
                    element child (except any inside legend), if any.
                    A disabled fieldset is unusable and un-clickable, a fieldset element is a
                    disabled fieldset if it matches the following conditions:
                    Its disabled attribute is specified, or is a descendant of another fieldset
                    element whose disabled attribute is specified, and is not a descendant of
                    element's first legend child: <code>&lt;fieldset <em>disabled</em>></code>

                <dd>The form attribute is used to explicitly associate the fieldset element with its
                    form owner (which form the fieldset belongs to).
                    The value of this attribute must be equal to the id attribute of a &lt;form>
                    element in the same document: <code>&lt;fieldset form=<em>"value"</em>></code>

        </details>
        </p>

        <h4>legend Element - &lt;legend></h4>
        <p>Element represents a caption for the rest of the contents of the &lt;legend> element's
            parent &lt;fieldset> element.
        </p>

        <h4>output Element - &lt;output></h4>
        <p>Element is used to represent the result of a calculation performed by the application, or
            result of a user action (eg: one performed by a script).
            This element can be contrasted with the &lt;samp> element, which is the appropriate
            element for quoting output of other programs run previously.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>output Attributes</em></b></summary>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>for</strong></dt>
                <dd>The for attribute specifies the relationship between the result of a
                    calculation, and the elements used in the calculation.
                    Allows an explicit relationship to be made between a result, and the elements
                    that went into or that influenced the calculation.
                    The attribute, must contain a string of an unordered unique space-separated list
                    of ids of one or more elements.
                    None of which that are identical to another token, and each of which must have
                    the value of an ID of an element in the same tree: <code>&lt;output for=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                </dd>

                    reference form data after it has been submitted, or to reference the element in
                    a JavaScript.
                    The &lt;output> element is associated with a form so it can be easily referenced
                    from the event handlers of form controls, value itself is not submitted when the
                    form submitted:
                    <code>&lt;output name=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </details>
        </p>

        <h3>Configuring a form to communicate with a server</h3>
        <p>Form submissions are exposed to servers in a variety of ways, most commonly as <em>HTTP
            GET or POST</em> requests.
            To specify the exact method used, the <em>method</em> attribute is specified on the &lt;form>
            element.
            This doesn't specify how form data is encoded, though; to specify that, use the <em>enctype</em>
            attribute.
            Also, you have to specify the URL of the service that will handle the submitted data,
            using the <em>action</em> attribute.
            For each form control you want submitted, you then have to give a name that will be used
            to refer to the data in the submission.
            When a form is submitted, the data in the form is converted into the structure specified
            by the <em>enctype</em> attribute.
            Then it sent to the destination, specified by the <em>action</em> attribute, using the
            given method.
        </p>

        <h3>Client-side form validation</h3>
        <p>Forms can be annotated in such a way that the user agent will check the user's input
            before the form is submitted.
            The server still has to verify the input is valid (since hostile users can easily bypass
            the form validation)
            , but it allows the user to avoid the wait incurred by having the server be the sole
            checker of the user's input.
            The simplest annotation is the <em>required</em> attribute, which can be specified on
            &lt;input> elements to indicate that the form is not to be submitted until a value is
            given.
            - When a form is submitted, invalid events are fired at each form control that is
            invalid.
            This can be useful for displaying a summary of the problems with the form, since
            typically the browser itself will only report one problem at a time.
        </p>
        <h4>Enabling client-side automatic filling of form controls</h4>
        <p>Some browsers attempt to aid the user by automatically filling form controls, rather than
            having the user reenter their information each time.
            For example, a field asking for the user's <i>telephone number</i>, can be automatically
            filled with the user's phone number.
            To help the user agent with this, the <em>autocomplete</em> attribute can be used to
            describe the field's purpose.
        </p>

        <h3>Improving the user experience on mobile devices</h3>
        <p>Some devices, in particular those with <i>virtual keyboards</i> can provide the user with
            multiple input modalities.
            For example, when typing in a credit card number, the user may wish to only see keys for
            digits 0-9;
            while when typing in their name, they may wish to see a form field that by default
            capitalizes each word.
            Using the <em>inputmode</em> attribute we can select appropriate input modalities.
