<main><h2>Embedded Content</h2>
    <p>Embedded content is content that imports another resource into the document, or content from
        another vocabulary inserted into the document.
        Some Embedded Content Elements can have <em>'Fallback Content'</em>, witch is content that
        is used when an external resource cannot be.
    </p>

    <section><h3>HTML Hyperlinks</h3>
        <p>Links are a conceptual construct, and represent a connection between two resources; they
            are created with: <em>&lt;a>, &lt;area>, &lt;form> and &lt;link></em> elements.
            HTML Links are <em>Hyperlinks</em>, and are found in nearly all web pages; they allow
            users to click their way from page to page.
            A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify
            another target.
            To indicate a resource be downloaded, rather than immediately used, the
            <em>download</em> attribute can be specified on &lt;a> or &lt;area> elements (creates
            the hyperlink to that resource).
            The HTML <em>&lt;a></em> tag defines a hyperlink, the most important attribute of this
            element is the <em>href</em> attribute;
            which indicates a link's destination.
            When you move the mouse over a link, the arrow will turn into a 'little hand';
            by default, links will appear as follows in all browsers (Links can also be styled with
            <em><b>CSS</b></em>):
        <ul>
            <li><em>Unvisited Link</em> - Is underlined and blue.</li>
            <li><em>Visited Link</em> - Is underlined and purple.</li>
            <li><em>Active Link</em> - Is underlined and red.</li>
        </ul>
        Interactive user agents may also provide users with a means to follow hyperlinks using the
        &lt;link> element, somewhere within their user interface.
        </p>
        <p>A <em><b>file path</b></em> describes the location of a file in a web site's <em>folder
            structure</em>, there are two kinds of links in HTML:
        <ol>
            <li><em><strong>Absolute URLs</strong>: Links to an <b>External Resources</b></em>, this
                uses a <em>full URL</em> to link to a web page; this links to an external image or
                document hosted on another website.
            </li>
            <li><em><strong>Relative URLs</strong>: Witch are <b>Hyperlinks</b></em>, this is a <em>local
                link</em> to a page within the same website, and is specified with a <em>relative
                URL</em>;
                if the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <aside><h4>Bookmark Links</h4>
            <p>HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific
                parts of a web page; this is useful if a web page is very long.
                To create a bookmark, first create the bookmark, then add a link to it; when
                clicked, the page will scroll to the specified location of the bookmark:
            <ol>
                <li>Use the <em>id</em> attribute to create a bookmark: <code>&lt;h2
                    <em>id="C4"</em>>Chapter 4&lt;/h2></code>
                </li>
                <li>Then add a link to the bookmark, using the <em>hash character (<b>#</b>)</em>
                    from within the same page: <code>&lt;a <em>href="#C4"</em>>Jump to Chapter 4&lt;/a></code>
                    <br/>Or, you can add a link to a bookmark on another page, by specifying the
                    <em>webpage URL</em>: <code>&lt;a <em>href="html_page.html#C4"</em>>Jump to
                        Chapter 4 on the html_page&lt;/a></code>
                </li>
            </ol>
            To link to the top of the current page, you can use both of these methods:
            <code>href=<em>"#top"</em> | href=<em>"#"</em></code>
            </p>
            <p>A link does not have to only be text, it can also be an image or any other HTML
                element:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Links</strong> - To use an image as a link, just put an &lt;img>
                    tag inside of an &lt;a> element's tag.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Email Address Links</strong> - Use <em>mailto:</em> inside of the <em>href</em>
                    attribute, to create a link that opens the user's email program, and lets them
                    send a new email:
                    <code>&lt;a href=<em>"mailto:an_email@example.com"</em>>Send an
                        E-Mail&lt;/a></code>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Button Links</strong> - To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add
                    <em>JavaScript</em> code;
                    this allows to specify what happens on certain events, like a button click.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </aside>

        <h4>nav Element - &lt;nav></h4>
        <p>Element represents a section of a page that links to other pages, or parts within the
            page; it is a section with <em>navigation links</em>.
            Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a &lt;nav> element, it is primarily
            intended for sections that consist of major navigation blocks.
            It is common for footers to have a short list of links to various pages of a site, such
            as the <i>terms of service, the home page or a copyright page</i>.
            Screen readers, can also use this element to determine whether to omit the initial
            rendering of this content.
            You can use the &lt;nav> element as a way to determine what content on the page to
            initially skip or provide on request (or both).
        </p>

        <h4>a Element - &lt;a></h4>
        <p>Element defines a <em>Hyperlink</em> and is used to link from one page to another, the
            link text is the part visible; clicking it will send the reader to the specified URL
            address.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>a Attributes</em></b> - The link's destination is specified in the <em>href</em>
                attribute, if specified, it represents a hypertext anchor labeled by its contents.
                If no <em>href</em> attribute is specified, then the element represents a
                placeholder for where a link might otherwise have been placed, consisting of just
                the element's contents.
                If the global <em>itemprop</em> attribute is specified, then the <em>href</em>
                attribute must also be specified.
                The <em>target, download, ping, rel, hreflang, type and referrerpolicy</em>
                attributes must be omitted if the <em>href</em> attribute is not present.
            </summary>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>href</strong></dt>
                <dd>The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to (address of
                    the hyperlink), and is the most important attribute of the &lt;a> element:
                    <code>&lt;a href=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                    { Possible values: <em>Absolute URL</em> - Points to another web site, like:
                    <code>href="http://www.website.com/an_html_page.htm"</code> | <em>Relative

                    |
                    <em>Element Id</em> - Link to an element with a specified id within the page,
                    like: <code>href="#page-section"</code> | <em>Other Protocols</em> - like an
                    <code>https://, ftp://, mailto:, file:</code>, etc. | <em>Script</em> - Such as:
                    <code>href="javascript:alert('Hello');"</code> }

                <dt><strong>target</strong></dt>
                <dd>The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document: <code>&lt;a
                    target=<em>"_self|_blank|_parent|_top|framename"</em>></code>
                    { <em>_self</em> (Default) - Opens the linked document in the same frame as it
                    was clicked. | <em>_blank</em> - Opens the linked document in a new window or
                    tab. | <em>_parent</em> - Opens the linked document in the parent frame.

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>download</strong></dt>
                <dd>The download attribute specifies a target file specified in an <em>href</em>
                    attribute, and will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink, instead
                    of navigating to it.
                    The optional value of the attribute will be the new name of the file after it is
                    downloaded, if the value is omitted, the original filename is used.
                    There are no restrictions on allowed values, and the browser will automatically
                    detect the correct file extension, then add it to the file: <code>&lt;a
                        download=<em>"value"</em>></code></dd>
            </dl>

                <dd>The ping attribute specifies a list of URLs to be notified if the user follows
                    the hyperlink (URLs to ping).
                    When the user clicks on the hyperlink, the ping attribute will send a short HTTP
                    POST request to the specified URL.
                    Values must be a space separated list of one or more valid URLs, and is
                    typically used for tracking: <code>&lt;a ping=<em>"value"</em>></code></dd>

                <dd>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and
                    the linked document, it is only used if the <em>href</em> attribute is present.
                    Search engines can use this attribute to get more information about a link:
                    <code>&lt;a rel=<em>alternate|author|bookmark|external|help|license|next|nofollow|noreferrer|noopener|prev|search|tag</em>></code>

    <section><h3>Images</h3>
        <p>Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page, the HTML
            <em>&lt;img></em> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
            Images are technically linked to web pages, the &lt;img> tag creates a holding space for
            the referenced image.
            The tag is empty, and does not have a closing tag, it contains attributes only.
        <ul><strong>HTML Image Tags</strong>
            <li><em>&lt;img></em> - Defines an image.</li>
            <li><em>&lt;picture></em> - Defines a container for multiple image resources.</li>
            <li><em>&lt;map></em> - Defines an <em><b>image map</b></em>, witch is an image with
                clickable areas; defined with one or more &lt;area> tags.
            </li>
            <li><em>&lt;area></em> - Defines a clickable area inside an <em>image map</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong><em>Image as a Link</em></strong> - To use an image as a link, put the &lt;img> tag
        inside the &lt;a> tag: &lt;a href="web_page.asp"> &lt;img src="anImage.gif" alt="HTML
        Tutorial"> &lt;/a>
        - A background image can also be specified for almost any HTML element, using the HTML <em>style</em>
        attribute.
        Here is a list of the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (<i>Chrome,
            Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera</i>):
        <table>
            <caption><b><em>Common Image Formats</em></b></caption>

        Loading large images takes time, and can slow down a web page - use images carefully.
        </p>

        <h4>img Element - &lt;img></h4>
        <p>Element is used to define/embed an image, the tag creates a holding space for the
            referenced image. The &lt;img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, with no
            closing tag.
            To link an image to another document, simply nest the &lt;img> tag inside of an &lt;a>
            tag.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em>img Attributes</em></b> The &lt;img> tag has two required attributes,
                the <em>src</em> attribute; witch specifies the path to the image.
                And the <em>alt</em> attribute, witch specifies an alternate text for the image (it
                describes the image).
                It is the &lt;img> element's fallback content, if a browser cannot process or find
                an image, will display the value of the <em>alt</em> attribute - also used for
                screen readers.
                If the images are in a <em>sub-folder</em>, you must include the folder name in the
                <em>src</em> attribute: <code>&lt;img <em>src="/images/image1.gif"</em> alt="Image
                    Description"></code>
                <br/>An &lt;img> element also has a dimension attribute source, initially set to the
                element itself. The <em>width and height</em> attributes always define width and
                height of the image in pixels.
                Always specify the width and height of an image, if not specified, the web page
                might flicker while the image loads. The width, height and style attributes all
                valid in HTML; however, using the global <em>style</em> attribute, prevents styles
                sheets from changing the size of images - Suggest using.
            </summary>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>alt</strong> (Required)</dt>
                <dd>The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image, if a user
                    cannot view it or it is not available; also for users who use a screen reader.
                    Value should describe the image, and should explain where the link goes if the
                    image inside an &lt;a> element; use <i>alt=""</i> if the image is for
                    decoration.
                    A broken link icon and alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image:
                    <code>&lt;img alt=<em>"value"</em>></code> - To create a tooltip for an image,
                    use the global <em>title</em> attribute.

                <dd>The src attribute specifies the URL or address of the resource, there are two
                    ways to specify the URL in the src attribute. When a web page loads, the browser
                    gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page.
                    Therefore, make sure the image stays in the same spot in relation to the web
                    page, otherwise visitors will get a broken link icon and the <em>alt</em>
                    attribute text (its value): <code>&lt;img src=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                    { 1. Relative URL - Links to an image file hosted within the website, the URL
                    does not include a domain name. If the URL begins with a slash, it will be
                    relative to the domain: <code>src="/images/image.jpg" | src="image.jpg"</code> -
                    It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change
                    domain.
                    | 2. Absolute URL - Links to an external image hosted on another website:

        <section><h4>Image Maps</h4>
            <p>An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with
                <em>hyperlinks</em>, you can then create clickable areas on an image.
                The HTML &lt;map> tag defines an <em>image map</em>, and the areas are defined with
                one or more &lt;area> tags.
                An image, in the form of an &lt;img> element, may be associated with an image map.
                The image is inserted using the &lt;img> tag, the only difference from other images,
                is that you add a <em>usemap</em> attribute.
                The usemap value starts with a <em>hash tag (<b>#</b>)</em>, followed by the name of
                the image map, it is used to create a relationship between the image and the image
                map:
                <code>&lt;map <em>name="imagemap"</em>> &lt;img src="animage.jpg" alt="Image
                    Description" <em>usemap="#imagemap"</em>></code>
                <br/>Then, add the clickable areas defined using an &lt;area> element; you must also
                define the shape of the clickable area.
                You must also define coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the

                The &lt;map> element, in conjunction with an &lt;img> element and any &lt;area>
                element descendants, defines an image map.
                The areas are defined with one or more &lt;area> element tags, that defines the
                clickable areas.

    <section><h3>HTML Multimedia</h3>
        <p>Multimedia comes in many different formats, it can be almost anything you can hear or
            see, like <i>images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations and more</i>.
            Multimedia elements (media data) are stored in media files, the most common way to
            discover the type, is to look at the file extension.
            Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like, <em>.wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg,
                .wmv and .avi</em>.
            Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats, the first
            browsers had support for text only;
            limited to one font in a single color.
        </p>
        <h4>source Element - &lt;source></h4>
        <p>Element defines multiple media resources (source sets) for &lt;media> elements, and
            allows to specify <i>alternative video, audio and image files</i>.
            The browser will choose the first &lt;source> element it supports, based on support or
            viewport width.

        <h4>picture Element - &lt;picture></h4>
        <p>Element defines a container for multiple <em>image resources</em>, and allows to display
            for different devices or screen sizes.
            This can be based on the <i>screen pixel density, viewport size, image format and other
                factors</i>.
            The &lt;picture> element contains two tags, one or more &lt;source> tags; each referring
            to different images through the <em>srcset</em> attribute, and one &lt;img> tag.
            The &lt;img> element is required as the last child of the &lt;picture> element, used as
            a fallback option if none of the &lt;source> tags matches.
            Each source element has a <em>media</em> attribute that defines when the image is the
            most suitable.
            The browser will look for the first &lt;source> element, where the media query matches
            the current viewport width, and ignore any following &lt;source> elements.
            Then it will display the proper image that is specified within the <em>srcset</em>
            attribute:
            <code>&lt;source <em>media="(min-width: 285px)"</em> <em>srcset="image_option1.jpg"</em>></code>
            <br/>Instead of having one image scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple
            images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.
            This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view or device.
            Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats, if you have a small
            screen/device; its not necessary to load a large image file.
            There are two main purposes for the &lt;picture> element: <em><b>Bandwidth</b></em> - If
            you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file.
            And <em><b>Format Support</b></em> - Some browsers or devices may not support all image
            formats.
        </p>

        <section><h3>HTML Audio</h3>
            <p>The HTML &lt;audio> element is used to play an audio file on a web page, and the <em>controls</em>
                attribute adds audio controls;
                like <i>play, pause and volume</i>.
                The &lt;source> element allows to specify alternative audio files, which the browser
                may choose from; the browser will use the first recognized format.
                The text between the &lt;audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not
                support the &lt;audio> element.

            <aside><strong>HTML Audio DOM - Methods, Properties and Events</strong>
                <p>The HTML DOM defines methods, properties and events for the &lt;audio> element,
                    this allows to <i>load, play and pause audios</i>
                    ; as well as set <i>duration and volume</i>.
                    There are also <strong>DOM events</strong>, that can notify you when an audio
                    begins to <i>play, is paused, etc</i>;

            <p>Element defines sound content, it is used to embed sound content into a document;
                such as music or other audio streams.
                The tag contains one or more &lt;source> tags, with different audio sources; the
                browser will choose the first source it supports.
                There are three supported audio formats in HTML: <em><b>MP3, WAV and OGG</b></em>.
                Content may also be provided inside of the &lt;audio> element, intended for older
                web browsers which do not support audio;
                so legacy audio plugins can be tried.
                Or, to show text to the users of these older browsers, informing them of how to
                access the audio contents.
                To make audio content accessible, <em><b>chapter titles</b></em> can be provided to
                aid navigation; using the &lt;track> element and a WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks
                Format) file.
                If captions or sign language are available, the &lt;video> element can be used
                instead of the &lt;audio> element;
                thus allowing users to enable the visual alternatives.
                And, naturally, <em>transcripts or other textual alternatives</em>, can be provided
                by simply linking to them in prose near the &lt;audio> element.

        <section><h3>HTML Video</h3>
            <p>The HTML &lt;video> element is used to show a video on a web page, and the <em>controls</em>
                attribute adds video controls, like <i>play, pause and volume</i>.
                The &lt;source> element allows to specify alternative video files, which the browser
                may choose from;
                the browser will use the first recognized format.
                The text between the &lt;video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not
                support this element.
                It is also a good idea to always include <em>width and height</em> attributes, if
                not; the page might flicker while the video loads.
            </p>
            <aside><strong>HTML Video DOM - Methods, Properties, and Events</strong>
                <p>The <strong>HTML DOM</strong> defines <em>methods, properties and events</em> for
                    the &lt;video> element, this allows to <i>load, play and pause</i> videos;
                    as well as <i>setting duration and volume</i>.
                    There are also <em><b>DOM events</b></em>, that can notify you when a video
                    begins to <i>play, is paused, etc</i>;

            <h4>video Element - &lt;video></h4>
            <p>Element is used for playing videos or movies, and also audio files with captions;
                this element also supports dimension attributes.
                The &lt;video> tag contains one or more &lt;source> tags with different video
                sources, the browser will choose the first source it supports.
                There are three supported video formats in HTML: <em><b>MP4, WebM, and OGG</b></em>.
                Content may be provided inside of the &lt;video> element, witch is intended for
                older web browsers that do not support video;
                so legacy video plugins can be tried.
                Or, also to show text to the users of these older browsers, informing them of how to
                access the video contents.
                The text between the &lt;video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not
                support the element.
                To make video content more accessible, a variety of features are available; like
                <em>sign-language tracks</em>, witch can be embedded in the video stream.
                <em>Captions</em> can also be provided, either embedded in the video stream or as
                external files using the &lt;track> element.
                <em>Audio descriptions</em> can also be embedded in the video stream, or in text
                form, using a WebVTT (<em>Web Video Text Tracks Format</em>) file referenced using
                the &lt;track> element.
                Witch then can be synthesized into speech, by the user agent; WebVTT can also be
                used to provide <em>chapter titles</em>.
                <em>Transcripts or other textual alternatives</em>, can also be provided by simply
                linking to them in the prose near the &lt;video> element.

        <p>An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page, the &lt;iframe> element
            specifies an inline frame.
            An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
            It is a good practice to always include a <em>title</em> attribute, this is used by
            screen readers to read what the content of the iframe is.
            An iframe can also be used as the target frame for a link, the <em>target</em> attribute
            of the link must refer to the <em>name</em> attribute of the iframe.
        </p>
        <h4>iframe element - &lt;iframe></h4>
        <p>Element defines an inline frame, an inline frame is used to embed another document within
            the current HTML document, it represents its nested browsing context (content
            navigable).
            The element never has fallback content, as it will create a new child navigable,
            regardless of whether initial contents successfully used.
            In <em>legacy user agents</em> that do not support &lt;iframe> elements, the contents
            would be parsed as markup that could act as fallback content.
            The &lt;iframe> element also supports dimension attributes, for cases where the embedded
            content has specific dimensions.
            It is a good practice to always include a <em>title</em> attribute for the &lt;iframe>,
            it is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the &lt;iframe> is.

            <summary><b><em>iframe Attributes</em></b> - If the global <em>itemprop</em> attribute
                is specified on an &lt;iframe> element, then the <em>src</em> attribute must also be
                specified.
                If the <em>src</em> attribute and the <em>srcdoc</em> attribute are both specified
                together, the <em>srcdoc</em> attribute takes priority.
                This allows authors to provide a fallback URL, for legacy user agents that do not
                support the <em>srcdoc</em> attribute.

            <dl>

                <dd>The src attribute specifies the address (the URL) of the document to embed in an
                    &lt;iframe>. If the src attribute and the <em>srcdoc</em> attribute are both
                    specified together, the srcdoc attribute takes priority.
                    This allows authors to provide a fallback URL for legacy user agents that do not
                    support the <em>srcdoc</em> attribute. If the global <em>itemprop</em> attribute
                    is specified on an &lt;iframe> element, then the src attribute must also be
                    specified: <code>&lt;iframe src=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                    { Possible values: <em>Absolute URL</em> - Points to another web site, like:
                    <code>src="http://www.website.com/source_page.htm"</code> | <em>Relative
                        URL</em> - Points to a file within a web site, like: <code>src="local_source.htm"</code>
                    }

                <dd>The srcdoc attribute gives the content of the page, that the element's content
                    navigable (nested browsing context) is to contain. The value of the attribute is
                    the source of an iframe srcdoc document, and specifies the HTML content of the
                    page to show in the &lt;iframe>.
                    This attribute is expected to be used together with the <em>sandbox and
                        seamless</em> attributes: <code>&lt;iframe srcdoc=<em>"value"</em>></code>
                    - If the <em>src</em> and srcdoc attribute are both specified together, the <em>srcdoc</em>
                    attribute takes priority. If a browser does not support the srcdoc attribute, it
                    will show the file specified in the <em>src</em> attribute instead (if present).
                    This allows authors to provide a fallback URL for legacy user agents that do not
                    support the srcdoc attribute.

        <h4>HTML YouTube Videos</h4>
        <p>The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube; as converting videos to
            different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.
            YouTube will display an <em>id</em> (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video;
            can use this id, and refer to the video in HTML code.
            To play a video on your web page, do the following:
            &lt;iframe width="420" height="315"
            <em>src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY"</em>> &lt;/iframe>
        <ol>
            <li>Define an <em><b>&lt;iframe></b></em> element in your web page.</li>
            <li>Let the <em>src</em> attribute point to the video URL.</li>
            <li>Use the <em>width and height</em> attributes to specify the dimension of the player.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Add <em>loop=1</em> to let your video loop forever, or <em>controls=0</em> to not display
        controls in the video player.
        You can also add <em>mute=1 and autoplay=1</em>, to let your video start playing both
        automatically and muted:
        <em>src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1&mute=1"></em>
        <br/><strong>YouTube Playlist</strong> - Add a comma separated list of videos to play, in
        addition to the original URL.
        </p>

        <h5>&lt;frame></h5>
        <p>Element defines a window (a frame) in a frameset - Not supported in HTML5.</p>
        <h5>&lt;frameset></h5>
        <p>Element defines a set of frames - Not supported in HTML5.</p>
        <h5>&lt;noframes></h5>
        <p>Element defines an alternate content for users that do not support frames - Not supported

    <section><h3>Document metadata</h3>
        <p>HTML metadata is data about the HTML document (data about data), and is not displayed but
            is machine parsable.
            The metadata content, is content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest
            of the content.
            It also sets up the relationship of the document with other documents, or conveys other
            "out of band" information.
            Elements from other namespaces, whose semantics are primarily metadata-related (e.g.
            RDF) are also metadata content.
            The &lt;head> element defines metadata about the document, and is a container for the
            metadata;
            it is placed between the &lt;html> and &lt;body> tags.
            The HTML &lt;head> element is a container for the following elements: <em>&lt;base> -
                &lt;link> - &lt;meta> - &lt;noscript> - &lt;script> - &lt;style> - &lt;template> -
                &lt;title></em>
            <br/>Metadata typically defines the document <i>title, character set, styles, scripts,
                and other meta information</i>.
            Metadata is used by browsers for how to display content or reload a page, also by search
            engines for keywords and is used for other web services.
            To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must also know the character set used
            in the page.
            There is also a method to let web designers take control over the <em>viewport</em> (the
            web page's visible area), through the &lt;meta> tag.
        </p>

        <h4>meta Element - &lt;meta> </h4>
        <p>Element defines metadata about an HTML document, metadata is data about data, and the
            tags always go inside of the &lt;head> element.
            The metadata will not be displayed, but is machine parsable; it is used by browsers for
            how to display content or reload a page, search engines for keywords and other web
            services.
            The element is typically used to specify <i>character set, page description, keywords,
                author of the document and viewport settings</i>.
            It represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the <em>&lt;title>,
                &lt;base>, &lt;link>, &lt;style> and &lt;script></em> elements.
            There is also a method to let web designers take control over the <em>viewport</em> (the
            visible area of a web page), to create a <em><b>Responsive Web Design</b></em>.
            A responsive web page will automatically adjust for different screen sizes or viewports.

            <summary><b><em>meta Attributes</em></b> - Exactly one of the <em>name, http-equiv,
                charset and itemprop</em> attributes must be specified.
                The &lt;meta> element can represent document-level metadata with the <em>name</em>
                attribute, pragma directives with the <em>http-equiv</em> attribute and a file's
                character encoding with the <em>charset</em> attribute.
                If either <em>name, http-equiv or itemprop</em> is specified, then the
                <em>content</em> attribute must also be specified; otherwise, it must be omitted.
                If a &lt;meta> element has no <em>content</em> attribute, then the value part of the
                metadata name-value pair is the empty string.

                <dd> The name attribute specifies the name for the metadata, it sets the aspect of
                    the documents metadata. Document metadata is expressed in terms of name-value
                    pairs, the name attribute giving the name, and the <em>content</em> attribute
                    (on the same element) giving the value.
                    If a meta element has no <em>content</em> attribute, then the value part of the
                    metadata name-value pair is the empty string. If the <em>http-equiv</em>
                    attribute is set, the name attribute should not be set.
                    HTML5 has also introduced a method to let web designers take control over the

        <h4>link Element - &lt;link> </h4>
        <p>Element defines the relationship between a document, and an external resource; it allows
            authors to link their document to other resources.
            It is an empty element, and contains attributes only; it is most often used to link
            external style sheets or to add <em>favicon</em> (icons) to a website.
            Two categories of links can be created using the &lt;link> element, links to <em><b>external
                resources</b> and <b>hyperlinks</b></em>.
            One link element can create multiple links, of which some might be external resource
            links, and some might be hyperlinks.

                The <em>imagesrcset and href</em> attributes, if width descriptors not used,
                together contribute the image sources to the source set.
                A link element must also have either a <em>rel or itemprop</em> attribute, but not
                both.
                The types of link indicated (the relationships) are given by the value of the <em>rel</em>
                attribute, if used, the element can only sometimes be used in the page body.
                When used with the <em>itemprop</em> attribute, the element can be used in the head
                element and body of the page.
                Hyperlinks created with the <em>rel</em> attribute apply to the whole document, this
                contrasts with the rel attribute of &lt;a> and &lt;area> elements.

    <section><h3>Programming</h3>
        <section><h4>HTML JavaScript</h4>
            <p>JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web, it can update or change both <em><b>HTML
                and CSS</b></em>; JavaScript can also <i>calculate, manipulate and validate data</i>.
                When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a <strong>Document Object
                    Model</strong> of the page, the <em><b>HTML DOM model</b></em> is constructed as
                a tree of Objects;
                and is an <em><b>API</b> (Application Programming Interface)</em> for JavaScript.
                Scripts allow authors to add interactivity to their documents, the HTML &lt;script>
                tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
                Script-supporting elements are those that do not represent anything themselves (are
                not rendered), but are used to support scripts.
                The &lt;script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an
                external script file through the <em>src</em> attribute.
                Common uses for JavaScript are <i>image manipulation, form validation and dynamic
                    changes of content (such as style or attributes)</i>.
                Through scripting and using other mechanisms, the values of <i>attributes, text and
                    the structure of a document</i> may change while a user agent is processing it.
                User agents update their presentation of the document as this occurs.
                Servers should use <em>text/javascript</em> for JavaScript resources, in accordance
                with Updates to <em>ECMAScript Media Types</em>, <em><b>ECMAScript 5</b></em> is
                also known as <em>JavaScript 5 or ECMAScript 2009</em>.
            </p>
            <p>When you want to access HTML elements with <em>JavaScript</em>, you have to find the
                elements first; there are a couple of ways to do this:
            <ul>
                <li>By: <b>id</b>.</li>
                <li>By: <b>tag name</b></li>
                <li>By: <b>class name</b></li>
                <li>By: <b>CSS selectors</b></li>
                <li>By: <b>object collections</b></li>
            </ul>
            JavaScript most often uses the <em>document.getElementById()</em> method, this example
            writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element: <code>&lt;script>
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"; &lt;/script></code>
            - The global <em>id</em> attribute, can also be used by JavaScript to perform tasks for
            that specific element.
            <br/>You can also use the <em>comment tag</em> to hide scripts, or comment on code; <em>two
                forward slashes (<b>//</b>)</em> at the end of a comment line, is the JavaScript
            comment symbol: <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"> <em>
                <!-- function displayMsg() { alert("Hello World!") } - A comment! //--></em> &lt;/script></code>
            <br/>Authors are encouraged to make their applications degrade gracefully, in the
            absence of scripting support.
            Look at the &lt;noscript> element, for users that have disabled scripts, or a browser
            that doesn't support client-side scripting.
            </p>

            <h4>script Element - &lt;script></h4>
            <p>Element allows authors to include <em>dynamic script and data blocks</em> in their
                documents, it does not represent user content.
                The element either contains scripting statements/client-side script (JavaScript), or
                it points to an external script file through the <em>src</em> attribute.
                There are several ways an external script can be executed.

                        Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page, to be
                        requested from another domain outside their own.
                        CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server,
                        among many other things. It defines a way of how a browser and server, can
                        interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.
                        The opposite of cross-origin requests is same-origin requests, this means a
                        web page can only interact with other documents on the same server: <code>&lt;script
                            crossorigin=<em>"anonymous|use-credentials"</em>></code>

                        ensure that the code is never loaded if the source has been manipulated.
                        Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a W3C specification, that allows web
                        developers to ensure resources hosted on third-party servers have not been
                        altered - Use of SRI is recommended. When using SRI, the webpage holds the
                        hash, and the server holds the file, the browser downloads the file, then
                        checks it, to make sure it is a match with the hash in the integrity
                        attribute.
                        If it matches, the file is used, and if not, the file is blocked; you can

                It represents nothing if scripting is enabled, but represents its children when
                scripting is disabled.
                The &lt;noscript> element can be used in both the &lt;head> and &lt;body> elements,
                when inside &lt;head>, it can only contain &lt;link>, &lt;style> and &lt;meta>

                clear how much work remains.
                Or the progress is a number in the range zero to a maximum, giving the fraction of

        <section><h3>HTML Plug-ins</h3>
            <p>Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser.
                The term <em><b>plugin</b></em> refers to an implementation-defined set of content
                handlers, used by the user agent;
                and that can take part in the user agent's rendering of a <strong>Document
                    object</strong>.
                <br/>Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>To run <strong>Java applets</strong> - <em>Most browsers no longer support Java
                    Applets and Plug-ins.</em></li>
                <li>To display <strong>maps</strong></li>
                <li>To <strong>scan for viruses</strong></li>
                <li>To run <strong>Microsoft ActiveX controls</strong> - <em>ActiveX controls are no
                    longer supported in any browsers.</em></li>
                <li>To <strong>verify a bank id</strong></li>
                <li>To display <strong>Flash movies</strong> - <em>The support for Shockwave Flash
                    has also been turned off in modern browsers.</em></li>
            </ul>
            Typically such content handlers are provided by third parties, though a user agent can
            also designate built-in content handlers as plugins.
            </p>

            <h4>object Element - &lt;object></h4>
            <p>Element defines an embedded object, it is a container for an external resource, and
                is supported by all browsers;
                it also supports dimension attributes.
                The external resource can be a <i>web page, a picture, a media player or a plug-in
                    application</i>.
                Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the
                browser, and have been used for many different purposes.
                The &lt;object> tag was originally designed to embed browser Plug-ins (like <i>Java
                    applets, PDF readers and Flash Players</i>) in web pages.
                It can also be used to include images, video and HTML in HTML if you like.
                To embed a picture, it is better to use the &lt;img> tag, for video or audio, it is
                better to use the &lt;video> and &lt;audio> tags.
                And, to embed HTML, it is better to use the &lt;iframe> tag.

                And, to display HTML, it is better to use the &lt;iframe> tag.
                The &lt;embed> element is supported in all major browsers, web browsers have
                supported it for a long time.

            A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page, by default, a canvas has no border and
            no content.
            Canvas has several methods for drawing <i>paths, boxes, circles, text and adding
                images</i>.
            The &lt;canvas> element is only a container for graphics, you must use
            <em><b>JavaScript</b></em> to actually draw the graphics.
        </p>
        <h4>canvas Element - &lt;canvas></h4>
        <p>Element is used to draw graphics via scripting, it is only a container for graphics; you
            must use JavaScript to actually draw graphics.
            The &lt;canvas> element provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas,
            which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, art, or other visual images.
            Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text and adding images.
            Authors must also provide content that conveys essentially the same function or purpose
            as the canvas's bitmap.
            This content may be placed as content of the &lt;canvas> element, this content is the
            element's fallback content.
            Any text inside the element will be displayed in browsers when JavaScript is disabled,
            and also in browsers that do not support the &lt;canvas> tag.
            Always specify an <em>id</em> attribute to be referred to in a script, and to add a
            border, use the <em>style</em> attribute.
        <details>
            <summary><b><em></em></b> - The canvas element has two attributes to control the size of

        <h3>HTML Graphics - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</h3>
        <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, it defines vector-based graphics in
            <strong>XML</strong> format.
            SVG is used to define graphics for the Web, and is a W3C recommendation.
            The HTML &lt;svg> element is a container for SVG graphics, and has several methods for
            drawing <i>paths, boxes, circles, text and graphic images</i>.
        </p>
        <h4>svg Element - &lt;svg></h4>
        <p>The &lt;svg> tag defines a container for SVG graphics, and has several methods for
            drawing <i>paths, boxes, circles, text and graphic images</i>:
            <code>&lt;svg width="200" height="100"> <em>SVG Content</em> &lt;/svg></code>
        </p>
        <h4>Differences Between SVG and Canvas</h4>
        <p><em><b>SVG</b></em> is a language for describing 2D graphics in <em>XML</em>, while
            <em><b>Canvas</b></em> draws 2D graphics, with a <em>JavaScript</em>.
            Since SVG is XML based, this means every element is available within the <em>SVG
                DOM</em>; you can then attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.
            Each drawn shape is remembered as an object, and if the attributes of an SVG object are
            changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.
            <br/>Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by
            the browser.
            If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any
            objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a
        complete understanding of some of the more technical parts.
        An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS
        will also be helpful in places but is not essential.
